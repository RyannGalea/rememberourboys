    "comment": "David was one of the best people in the world, his personality was one of a kind, his joyful nature and kindness was always loved and was just what we had come to expect from Dave.. he was the most amazing person i have come to love in my life thus far and as i sit here cry i wonder if this could be all true or just a bad bad dream.. David Andrews was traveling over razorback from camden at around 9.30pm Friday the 29th of October 2004, were he lost control of his car on a bad stretch of road and rolled out of control into a enbankment. on this night he lost his life.. its just not fair. hearing this is truly the worst moment in my life, i now sit and wonder how this could happen to such a great person.. it has made me realise how fragile life is and to make the most of the people around you while you can. My thoughts are with his family and the people around him, Dave was too young to die and didnt deserve this... You will always be part of the crew and I know you will always be there watching upon us...  im sure i speak for absolutely evryone when i say we will always miss you dave and will always love you with all our hearts.. You will be truly missed by everyone! especially me.\n\n Ride on David Neil Andrews.. You Will Never Be Forgotten\nNarz"

What i do know though is that everyone has so many good memories when it comes to dave  and he is never goin to be forgotten by a single person in the Dilly. He will always be remembered for his craziness, and just the little things that made him who he was... It jus goes to show you never realise how much somebody means to you until they're gone, and what a huge impact they have on your life.  Everyone will miss you Dave R.I.P  , look over us won't you xxxx"

And you know what, it aint often that you will find someone and no matter who you are or who you hang around, you could always be their mate. Moments shared with you were always good times! And from reading all of these messages your whole life must have been a huge party! This has to be the biggest kick in the  guts everyone has ever had! You don't have to ever worry that we will never stop thinking of you...unless we're thinking of what the time is, or where the fuck we left our keys, but really, you have left a massive impression on everyone you'v ever met. We will never forget you mate!\n\nTell old mate up there that I'm gona have 2have a word with him about this one day. What was he thinking! the guy must be on drugs! R.I.P. champ!!!"

We have seen so many accidents like this in our area, and not one has hit or effected such a large number of people as this has. Over the last few days we have seen so many of Daves friends and family go to any lengh to do things the way Dave would have wanted. It really does show how great he was. Dave really was what made and broke what we all know as the Dilly. I will never forget the great times I have shared with Dave as I am sure most of us will remember them. When I think of Dave I just see that big smile of his that he did as he would pull his head back, it was one of a kind, in fact so was he. I have known Dave ever since we were really young and he has always been a big brother to everyone he knew. He will be missed dearly by everyone. If we learnt something from Dave it would have been... To live life for today and not for tomorrow dont have regrets do what you want to do and dont wait.We all love you, you wont be forgotten. x x x"

R.I.P my brother, untill the next time we meet, keep on partying and smiling along the way. love you dave, i will never forget you.Christopher James Roche."

Even though i did not know him as well as others, alot of my childhood memories have him in it. Growing up in Bargo in the same street for 14 years with someone does mean alot to ppl around here. I will miss seeing him outside his house or Chris's house waving like crazy at me just to get a giggle out of me or even a smile. I remember him most for that, making ppl laugh. Dave we will miss you, it won't be the same without you, the loss of you has brought so much sadness but left alot of happy memories to remember you by. No one deserves this, especially you. All my sympathy goes to your parents, brothers, sister and to shannon xoxo"

Your support to me, Betty, the rest of the family and Shannon over the past week or so has given us much strength. Daby had an unusual outlook (very carefree) on life but I am sure he lived his life to the Max. He was a great son whom we all will miss. To the Dilly Boys Thanks for you help and support. Thanks for the magnificent cross now at David's grave site. Just show us how much he meant to you all and I know the cross is fro your hearts. May be Narz may be kind enough to put a picture on the site to show everyone what I mean. Thanks again to you all, we know your thoughts are still with us.\n\nNarz thank you for a beautiful tribute to my son."

From listening to the great things people have said it's clear that he was an amazing person to have touched so many lives in such a short time. This is for his friends, I hope you agree:\nDo not stand on my grave and weep,\nfor I am not there I do not sleep,\nI am the thousand winds that blow\na diamonds glint upon the snow,\nI am the soft sun of ripened grain,\nthe soft gentle autumn rain.\nAnd when you wake in the morning hush,\nI am the soft uplifting rush\nthe quiet birds that curve in flight\nthe timeless stars that shine at night\nso do not stand at my grave and cry,\nI am not there\nI did not die.\nHe's always with you as you've said, and my thoughts and prayers are for all he loved."

Dave always had a smile on his face whenever i saw him and he was always full of nergy and keen to ride.  He always somehow seemes to be the life in the session. Not only a rider like that but a person like that is hard to come by and is a tragic loss like that just doesnt seem fair.

The boys are right - the best part of the Dilly  has been taken from us.. but no goodbyes - just see you soon. RIP Dave, Look after everyone like you always have and we'll continue to look up to you.

I only just discovered this website after reading the Wollondilly Advertiser.  I decided to have a look and I only got to page 23 of 64 and found myself in a heap on the floor, coz of all the things everyone has said about you Dave.  Your smile must have been amazing, your body must have been the brightest light, your peddles led the way for all the weride crew. I was there the night you had your accident, I was on Razorback and I was asked to turn around, when I asked if the person was ok, the policeman told me that it wasn't looking good. From the moment that I turned my car around till the time I reached my destination I was praying that it wasn't someone we knew, not another young person to die on our roads. I was horribly wrong. The next morning when I was told it was you, a picture of you popped up in my head, that picture has never left. I din't attend your funeral Dave, I felt I didn't know you well enough to be there with you, I heard about that day though and all that happened, I heard about the weride crew leading the way for you, I heard about the nuddy run everyone did in remembrance of you walking around half the time with no clothes on and I heard about all the tears that were shed and after reading this site and hearing all those things, it has shown me that you were one in a million Dave, you were significant to all. All that you knew, you made feel special in your own way. To everyone out there that was close to Dave, don't dwell on the past, look toward the future, Dave wouldn't want you to be sad, remember the good times and don't be affraid of crying once in a while, but most of all, I kno you will never forget Dave so don't be scared to move on. To Dave's family, I know how it feels to lose someone close in your family, it hurts like hell, trust me, it will get easier, my thoughts are with you all.  Rest In Peace Dave.

Word's can't express the way we feel, but I can get some comfort in knowing that David has had such a profound effect on so many and that he has left so many wonderful memories in his short life. To all those friends who used to come and visit us, please keep in touch - we would love to see you! David did have a special gift - the gift of making people smile and I think that's the memory most of us will cherish forever.

Although I didn't really know Dave personally, I can see from this site that so many people knew and loved him and my thoughts are with you all. I was also good friends with Dave's sister Deirdre during school. It is terrible, but it takes something like this to make us all realise the importance of being there for your friends, telling them how much you care about them, and of not letting the rest of your life get in the way of friendships. So to Deirdre and all of my other friends who I have slowly lost contact with over the years, I do care about you and will always be there for you if you need me xxx"

By the way, I have read alot of messages which tell of funny antics David got up to. Any more would be great - they bring a big smile to my face. Thanks again to all you guys.

You, are truly one in a million and at night as we look to the heavens we will know you are watching over us because youll be that biggest and the  most beautiful twinkling star thats shining the brightest of them all.... just as you shone in your life.\n           \n          To Betty and Ross--- You must take all the credit for raising such a caring, good natured, loving Son. You must also be one in a million as David, in fact all of your children could only be what you guys laid the foundations for them to be. You must be very proud of them all!!!\n REST IN PEACE  DAVID NEIL ANDREWS xxxxxxxxxxx\n....xxxx YOU WILL ALWAYS REMAIN IN OUR HEARTS AND NEVER BE FORGOTTEN xxxx_____We Love You xxxx     from the Ripley (Rigs's) Family"

So i just thought i'd post a poem i wrote directly after the incident.\n\nI just don't want to say goodbye, a David Andrews tribute:\n\nI am being strong on the outside, but I'm shattered on the inside, I just can't believe you're gone; it's so unfair to lose a mate so soon.\n\nMy heart is aching, my mind is all over the place, I just don't want to say goodbye, and it's just too soon!\n\nThey say that you never forget your time growing up, the laughs, the tears, but you never want to go through the pain of having to say goodbye to a mate way before his time under such tragic circumstances.\n\nI am writing this tribute to express how I feel, but I just don't want to say goodbye, it's way too soon.\n\nWe had so many great memories growing up together, I'll never forget them and I'll miss you forever. The tears are still flowing, and the pain will not subside, the fun memories, I hold close to my heart of us growing up throughout our years in high school, I'll never forget and thinking about them now just tear me apart, make me cry, but I just can't handle the fact that I have to say goodbye.\n\nI keep thinking you'll be back, you've just gone on a holiday, but I know deep down you're up in heaven making it a better place with your charisma and laughter, that we all had the pleasure of experiencing.\n\nThe tears are dripping as I piece together this tribute for you my friend, you were such a unique character in every facet.\n\nI'll miss you mate, and I'll never forget you and how you touched my life.\n\nLove, Powelly."

It was gross back then but a very cherished memory now.\nI never really met Dave until his 18th but i always saw him up at hectors riding around on his pushie with no shirt on. \nMy thoughts and respect go to Daves family for producing such a good guy, and shaping him in to the man that he became.\nDave will always live on in everybodys hearts and thoughts.\nLove Mel kruf \nR.I.P David Neil Andrews."

    "comment": "As a police officer I have had the unfortunate task of attending many tragic accidents. On the night in question, I was the officer that attended the scene of Dave's accident. I immediately and strangely felt this strong sensation that Dave was a unique person.  I had this strange feeling that I had known Dave for years.  I sit here and read all of the messages that you wonderful people have typed.  To have touched the hearts of so many people in such a short time is nothing short of a miracle. I wish that I could have met Dave and experience his great approach to life.  I would like to express that life is just so short.  After that night I went home and hugged my children and would not let them go. I immediately took leave and spent every minute of my leave with my wife and my two children. Let Dave's passing be a lesson to us all that friends and family are just so important. Hug your friends, tell your family that you love them, you never know when the last time you do this might come. For Dave's friends, when you have children, treat them like angels as they truly are that. Lets all take a leaf from Dave's book and be happy and treat life as a gift.  Ross, mate I am so sorry that we met under these circumstances.  You are truly a strong man and I commend you for that.  Your family is such a wonderful family and that is a credit to you and Betty.  Betty, words cannot express how sorry I am to deliver the tragic news of Dave's passing.  I will remember that morning and your sorrow till the day I pass.  You have a great family and you are a great mum. Russell, Deirdre and Ian, guys you have a great brother whom was very proud of you.  I have spoken to you all and have felt the sorrow that you are suffering.  Man didn't your brother make an impact in this life. Shannon, keep your chin up and live a life that Dave would have wanted you to live. Remember all the good times that you guys had, I know that you guys will be together again one day.  To all of Dave's mates, you are very unique people.  You have all spoken so highly of Dave.  I wish that I had friends such as you guys.  I would love to meet you guys and talk about Dave and look at some of the pictures you guys speak about.  You all seem such great people.  Please come into Picton station some time and have a chat. To Dave, what can I say mate, although our paths crossed for a very short time, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for making me realise that my family and friends are what are so important to me.  As I said earlier, I have attended many accidents, but mate you touched my heart.  Rest in peace mate.  You were truly a gift from god."

How one young man has touched the hearts of so many is truly amazing and, Dave, I was lucky enough to be one who has known you since you were just a toddler. Your passing has made me realize just how very important friendships are and they are not to be taken for granted.\nLife is so fickle and we never know what lies around the corner so we need to take action now to ensure that we have no regrets if we are taken away as suddenly as you were Dave. Tell those you love that you love them, give them that extra hug. Follow Dave's example a give to others the friendships that are true...we saw many of your friends when they all gathered so say farewell..Dave - you are a young man that will always live in the hearts of your friends as they are better people by having had the honour of being able to call you their friend and mate. Even though you have made us very sad we will keep smiling because that is a tribute to your happy face. How we feel :( :(  and how we remember you :) :):):):):):):):):):):):)"

David was 1 of a kind and everyone who ever met him new this, there was something about him that made him stand out and made us love him. Whether it was his killer smile, his laugh, or his ability to make every minute u spent with him memorable. U will never meet another person who didnt have one person hate them. That just shows how much dave was loved. Dave was with us at the start and he will be with us at the end. Dave, u were a friend , a mate, a brother, a gift! To everyone one who every spent time with u, whether it be 1 minute or 20yrs. Thank u David Neil Andrews, u will never be forgotten. Love u mate. Peace."

I can only amagine how hard your life must feel, please find strength in the knowledge that Dave was loved by so many people & he will be with you always. I found this quote & thought of Dave\n\n In life we find an angel\n  that walks upon this earth\n  No wings or halo showing\n  but Heavens gift at birth \"\n\n  May we feel Dave's love beside us\n  to help us find the way\n  He is here within our presence\n  & will never fade away."

It is short and should be treated as though every day is your last.To daves parents, id like to thank you for the beautiful son u have raised and brought into our lives. It is true that,i too have never met a single person who has EVER had a bad word to say about dave. Also, i had Never once come across dave when he didn't have an unbelievable beautiful smile on his face! To the parents of dave,u are truely blessed to have had an angel with you every day for 20 years. To all Daves mates and Family,Grant and deano, bennos and matty lye, benny S,jacko, jad, scotty and jason, jess, ronny, shauny,etc. and to the many,if not hundreds more, no words that have ever entered my mind can express howbadly i feel for you all. feeling helpless towards my baby through all of his grief, i cannot even begin to imagine what you are all so bravely struggling through.To Constable darren moon,your words were touching for lack of a better term. Dave deserves the best and hopefully the best is where he is now,with my sister and many of our friends and family in heaven. Love ya Dave, you were and still are, an angel and one in a billion. we love u mate.                ***R.I.P***"

Once i got there i just cried and spoke to Dave as if he was standing there in front of me, i was exlianing how i felt and that i missed him so much. I am so grateful that i have done this, and from now on i'll be visiting there as much as possible. \n\nDave, you were with us for such a short time, but what you did in that time will stay with us forever, i miss you mate.\n\nLove Powelly."

The blitz was well concealed from Betty and well organised by those responsible. Please accept from me the families sincere thanks for your wonderful gesture of the memorial Garden, Pergola (Entertainment area), Pathways and Driveway. For you to feel so strongly about David to do this for us is absolutely wonderful. Please all step back and take a bow. You have all called David a friend and we can see that not only was he your friend but you were his friend. Thanks also must go to all the local businesses who have donated material for Davids friends to do this project. There were about 50 of Davids friends there on Saturday and about 30 on Sunday who worked extremely hard to ensure it was completed on time. Once again please accept the families sincere thanks. You also are truly special people and we are proud to know you."

Words cant explain how I felt when I came home and found my backyard transformed into the most beautiful memorial garden and to see all you guys there took my breath away. You are all so wonderful and what you have done for not only me but all our family over the past 8 weeks just shows the love you have for David and the great bond you have with each other. To have worked so hard to make the garden and driveway for us leaves me speechless. When you come around home now we will have a special place to sit and have a chat (I know David will be sitting there with us)- you know you are all welcome.\nFor most (if not all) of us every day is a struggle - there are tears and an overwhelming sadness but we are so thankful at being able to 'talk' to one another here and I for one am ever grateful to those who have made it possible.\nIf we stick together and help one another out when the going gets tough I'm sure we will learn to cope. Remembering all the good times and the joy that David bought to everyone helps us smile again! I am just so amazed as to the positive\neffect David had on so many people. \nFor now, THE BIGGEST THANK YOU to you all not only for the work you have just done for us but for all the other things - no matter how small. \nTry to have the best Christmas you can - enjoy the time you have with your family and friends, keep safe and we hope to see you sometime over the festive season.

I am spending this New Year's Eve alone, and wondering how your family and friends are coping, I know there will be many Christmases and New Years and all sorts of anniversaries we can't imagine but please know there is one person at least who drives over Razorback at least once a week and slows to a crawl at the spot marked with your name, and asks whoever, whatever that watches over us to watch over you and your family and to make sure wherever each of you are that you are ok."

Thanks to those who come around from time to time to have a chat - you know youre always welcome and thanks for being there for Ian, too. This time of the year is particularly hard for us and probably all you guys too - trying to join in the spirit knowing there is a great hole in our lives. We can only take each day at a time - some are OK and some arent and that's the way it will be. My dad had a saying that you have to learn to roll with the punches\". Trying to cope with this almost \"knock out punch\" is going to be a long, long process and we will have some good days and some bad days, but we have to realise that this is normal in the grieving process. Being there for one another is the best way to get through and move slowly forward. Thanks to those who sit and chat with Dave.Im sure he can sense all the visitors he has and the thoughtful ways you have decorated \"his place\". My best wishes go to everyone and to those still on holidays have a safe and happy time, to those of us back at work -at least we have something to keep us occupied I suppose. Bye for now."

Being able to write on this website is a godsend to many, including me, and having so many of David's friends visit helps in some way. This is the hardest thing we have all had to deal with probably and we have a choice really to 'sink' or 'swim', and I don't think David would want us to 'sink'. To look to the future knowing David won't be a part of it breaks my heart and there will be tears and sadness probably forever, but we do have the great memories and lots of people around us to love and comfort each other, so we try the best we can to cope. We will all come across times in our lives where we will hit rock bottom but we have to find the strength to 'rise up' again - and we will! Thanks again for thinking of us - you all have done so much to help us."

So we have organised a Celebration of Dave's life to be held on the 5th of February at Picton Bowling Club. It will be a coming together for all those who knew and loved Dave.\nIt will also be a night where we can come together as the Dilly\" community to help raise some money for the Andrews family.  Please refer to above emails as to where to purchase tickets. It will be a great night. There will be auctions and raffles with the prizes being donated from the local businesses. Many of whom don't usually donate but because it's for Dave gave generously.\nSo please get your tickets and tell your friends. The cost is $40, this includes a three course meal, drinks can be purchased from the bar and remember there is a courtesy 'bus to take us home. So be there for Dave.\nThank you Jo."

I went to see this lady with an open mind, not knowing what to expect and I was told a few things that really got me thinking. I was told, among other things, that at present David is taking care of the children (something he did here as well). Something had happened at home - an object was moved to a different spot in our kitchen when no-one was in the room. The psychic hadn't been told this and she mentioned to me (with a smile on her face at the time when it seemed David was telling her, smiling)that David moved the object as a joke. I like to think she's right, and I have no other explanation of how it moved. There are a couple more things which have happened which she hadn't been told about and it seemed David had mentioned to her (quite bazaar!), but I do believe that David is watching over us.\n\nJust thought I'd share this with you."

    "comment": "I just want to say thank you to all of you who went to visit David over the weekend. Doesn't his place look bright and cheery - just how he would like it to be. You guys never cease to amaze me with how you show us that David is so much a part of your lives and the respect you showed our family in particular when Ross gave his speech brought me to tears. I'm positive David would have loved the small quiet get-together we had on Friday and the way we celebrated his 21st on Saturday in a party-like atmosphere. Thanks again to everyone and I hope you all enjoyed yourselves at the dinner/auction."

This lady then said that she had known of someone, and she was then told that this person wanted to thank everyone for the tribute night (I don't even think this lady knew the tribute night was held) and also to thank everyone for keeping his 'site good'. She was also told that 'he was OK'. Also mentioned the name 'Al', who I have been told is the name of Jay Dowse(?) dad. Also the psychic mentioned that there will soon be a celebration or reception in a hall (Russell and Amy are getting married soon....) How about that!"

But i never new Dave, never saw him, never spoke to him. But recently i have been dreaming of this guy constantly, i had never saw this person before but in every dream he is driving and always has a smile on his face. Till yesterday i didnt know who he was. I found out because as i was looking for something on the internet and this website just popped up and once i saw that the picture on here was him, i broke down. Through my dreams Dave seems like the most beautiful person in the universe, his smile is so unlifting it scary. But i never met him when he was here with all you guys.

Maybe we could all put aside some quiet time on Sunday to reflect on some of the special moments we shared with David. Easter is particularly sad for my family as my sister Janet passed away from cancer 23 years ago on Good Friday. I feel Easter Sunday is one of the most special days of the year and it might be made all the more special if we take a step back, take some deep breaths and have some quiet time. Happy Easter to everyone and for those going away, please be careful and take a break every now and then if you're driving long distances. My love to everyone and thank you to all of you who keep this site going."

Dave is alwayz watching us, he hasnt missed out on anything in our lives. I know that nothing i nor anyone else can say will tak away the EMPTINESS we ALL feel inside, but i just thought i should share this. Dave is the BEST person i know, and nothing will ever change that, he will alwayz be Davey the litttle shit head that could make anyone smile when they were at their worst...

    "comment": "Well Russell and Amy's wedding went almost perfectly. We all know that there was one very important person missing. Dave was remembered during the night and was given a toast. Some time ago I mentioned that Shannon and I went to a local clairvoyant who mentioned to me to watch for a bird near a window-sill. I have been doing that and up until Saturday the only birds that I had noticed near window-sills were either indian minors and I figured David would have more class than to visit us as one of those ugly birds and half-drowned pigeons which looked pretty miserable. When Russell and Amy came around yesterday they were telling us that they had been woken by a 'peck-pecking' at the window quite early on Sunday morning - they spent their honeymoon night at Peppertree Ridge? Razorback (no not the nudist hippie place). They couldnt make out what the noise was, and when they woke up enough, they saw a kookaburra outside their window pecking away for some time. I mentioned what the clairvoyant had said to me and Russell figured it was in fact David getting him back for waking him up one afternoon by bashing the daylights out of Ian's drums. They say that good things come to those that wait and I knew that that bird would appear eventually."

Firstly I want to thank all of David's friends who, by their thoughtfulness and hard work, have now left an everlasting visual memory of David in the 'dilly. Secondly, I want to mention something that the spiritual medium said to me some months ago that will make the skatepark more meaningful for everyone I think - she told me that David didn't want to be remembered at Razorback, she said that 'David wanted to be remembered at his favourite place, and his friends knew where that was'. You guys got it so right! Well done!"

You all know that if you feel like you need a chat or a bit of comfort Im there for you. It helps me too to talk to you guys not only here but fact to face.

Dave was an amazing boy and you should both be happy that you were able to become apart of his life and expereince his love. There would be a thousand girls that would have jumped at the chance to steal a kiss or more (he was a hotty)but he chose to share these with you... stop being so nasty and rememeber the love and fun times that i know he brought to you both so often... he wouldnt want you to be nasty to each other and rather you support each other becuase you both knew in a loving and special way and only you can share that with each other... we know it is difficult and hard but think of dave.... he is very much missed and i couldnt imagine what it could be like to loose my boy but we should be trying to support each othernot fight....

Could we ever forget those priceless moments, the answer of course is never; for you were part of our lives for a brief time but youre part of our hearts forever\".

Another piece of our hearts are shattered. To Ros Bill Sarah and Emily my deepest sympathy. I know there are no words to describe the loss of such a loved child. Our boys had such wonderful friends and they become our friends. This is yet another time we will need one another for support and strength and I know that all you 'dilly people will be there for one another. There are so many questions that we will never get answers for and if we dwell on them too much they will eat us away.Who knows why these 2 special people have been taken away from us but let us try to take comfort in knowing that they are both together and in time will probably be causing mayhem (with alot of laughter in there too).\n\nMy love to everyone."

Everyone that has met the boys will know that they are both great guys and will never be forgotten no matter how many new people we meet no one will ever be able to fill their shoes, they were great guys and always will be, we will meet up with them again one day and it will be the happiest day ever but till then we have to remember the fun times we had with the boys and always remember that they would want us to think of the good times where everyone was laughing.\nStay strong and keep your chins up, both of the boys are up there now looking down on us and having a laugh and a beer remembering the good times.

Not many people even knew Mitch had a brain tumour, with his cancer experience i know it mad him a better person also alot stronger with what he went through he always had his ups and downs but he got through them. Mitch was always helping other people through there experiences with cancer through canTeen again not many people knew the envolement he had with canTeen, Mitch loved canTeen as he was always going on camps, always meeting the chicks.

Just before dave left us for another world our nana was out from NZ and we were all having dinner at mum's house and i remember dave saying to shannon that he wanted to loose some of the fat that he had around his stomach too much drinken he said\" and as he said that he reach across to amy's plate and took the rind of fat from a piece of steak and said to amy \"i'll have that\" and amy said \"you want to loose weight\" and dave said \"yea but the fat is the best part of the steak\" it was so funny, mainly because of his facial expressions and his sense of humour that he had.  I'd do anything to see him for just a few hours even minutes for him to see his new nephew.  We'll see you all on the 29th at the dirt park.

Some of the best times came from riding with you. but most others.. one thing that i can never forget was in the carolla one day.. doing close to 240 and thinking we were going to hit a speed hump and instead of starting to slow down we speed up and both at the same time looked at each other and said... see you on the other side.. probably close to the stupidest thing we did.. but these are all the things i miss the most. all these memories will stay close to me forever. wishing you were with us.. missing you for ever.."

Someone asked me a couple of weeks ago if things were getting easier as time went on - the answer was simply no, it doesnt get easier and in some ways it gets harder. Life is full of twists and turns and when the going gets tough we do need friends, family etc to get us through - talking helps and as Ive said before thank goodness for this website.\n\nPlease, if any of you feel like catching up, either ring me or call around.\n\nMy love to everyone and all the best Christmas and New Year - keep safe!"

'Cause I saw the end before we'd begun, It may be over but it won't stop there, You touched my heart you touched my soul. You changed my life and all my goals. And love is blind and that I knew when, My heart was blinded by you. I've kissed your lips and held your head, Shared your dreams. I know you well, I know your smell. I've been addicted to you. Goodbye my lover. Goodbye my friend. You have been the one. You have been the one for me.I am a dreamer but when I wake,\nYou can't break my spirit - it's my dreams you take.And as you move on, remember me, Remember us and all we used to be I've seen you cry, I've seen you smile. I've watched you sleeping for a while. I'd spend a lifetime with you. I know your fears and you know mine. We've had our doubts but now we're fine, And I love you, I swear that's true. I cannot live without you. Goodbye my lover.\nGoodbye my friend. You have been the one. You have been the one for me. And I still hold your hand in mine. In mine when I'm asleep. And I will bear my soul in time, When I'm kneeling at your feet. Goodbye my lover. Goodbye my friend. You have been the one. You have been the one for me.\nI'm so hollow,I'm so hollow.I'm so, I'm so, I'm so hollow. Mitch just a little song for you.\nEven everyones Christmas wishes put together can't bring you back and that breaks my heart. You know who this is from xoxo"

We really aren't apart.\nBe happy for me dear ones. You know I hold you dear,\nAnd glad I'm spending Christmas with Jesus Christ this year.\n\nI send you each a special gift from my heavenly home above. \nI send you each a memory of my undying love. After all Love\" is the gift; more precious than gold. \nIt was always most important in the stories that Jesus told.\n\nPlease love and keep each other, as our Father said to do, \nFor I can't count the blessings or love He has for you.\nSo, have a Merry Christmas and wipe away the tear.\nRemember, I'm spending Christmas with Jesus Christ this year."

We'd cherish each dream and each wish that you would make. Then after the sun had set we'd find the first star to remind you how bright-shining special you are. Thinking of the fun we would have if we could share this day. Wishing you lots of birthday smiles, hugs and kisses and happines your way. The way it should be for someone who's as wounderful as you.

David's 22nd is coming up on 4th Feb and I know the emptiness on that day even more than other days.\n\nNarz: I really like the new look on this site being different photos. Tell me, are you rotating photos as when the opening of the Dirt Park photo was up I sent my penpal in USA an email and told her to look on the website but next time I looked it was a different photo. As Im dumb at alot of computer stuff is there a way of letting my penpal know when that photo will be up again or will she have to fluke it! Thanks."

I know it is the one part of David's personality that both Russell and Ian would love to have and I guess if you do have that natural ability to put a smile on people's faces you don't really realise how lucky you are to be able to do that. We would all love to make the world a better place and we have to thank those few like David who have made our lives so much happier and these are the memories we need to hang onto. These are the memories that will help us get through the tough times and its nice to know that we will still be able to smile and even laugh when we remember some of David's antics. What a funny boy he was. Thanks so much for what you have just written - its the things like what you have just said that help us out even though it might bring a few tears.

Yes we have lost some beautiful kids in absolutely tragic circumstances and from a mum of one of these wonderful kids the effect on the family is devastating and it is with you every day. As a parent we can only imagine the pain that you all are going through again. Yes we all need to realise how precious our lives are and as young people your lives are all ahead of you - so much to enjoy. But in saying this I trust that what you have written IS based on fact and not hearsay or assumption. Somehow our kids do have to understand that life is precious and they need to take care - we as parents can't emphasise this enough. Our thoughts are with the families of Jack and Matt and again with all you young people."

R.I.P the Dilly Boys, u have all stolen our hearts. i know you wouldnt want us to cry but its just all we can do.. i cant wait to see all your smiling faces. xoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxo"

Matt I hope you realised how much of my life you really were, you were my first true love, my real best friend and that one person that could forgive me, understand me, and love me no matter what. Jacko, i'm to miss the messy stories youd tell me, the late nights, and miss the friendship we had. In the time we all spent together the good and bad and the experiences we had, I wouldn't change or take back one thing. I'm so grateful for every moment I got to spend with you two.. I don't know when how long it will be before I get to see you, but you guys will be on my mind and in my heart forever and I want you to know that.. I'll miss your friendships, I'll miss seeing you and Jacko round the dilly and most of all I'm going to miss growing up with you two. Say hello to Davey, and that I miss you all too much. I hope you're having a great time up there together again. I miss you too much Matty but life's short so I guess I'll see you soon.\nLove yous forever,\n                  \n                    TAZZY xoxo"

Tat & ben, your good friends of mine & i feel so much pain for the great loss of such a wonderful person (Matt). Ben, you keep living just the way Matt wanted you too!! You know i'm always here for you guys, life wouldn't be the same without you. Let's hope your babies a boy - couldn't be named after better people if it is! Bec, your a great friend to me too and i never thought we'd be catching up at such a tragic time, you keep in touch ' thinking of you. To dear Allan & Lucy, words can never be written and sounds can never be spoken to the amount of pain and loss you feel at this time. From Tat & I trying to push Matt out of the way cause he was hogging the mirror in the bathroom, making Matt pose for a photo as 'Cat in the Hat' to turning up to your house with it packed full of people rushing everywhere will always be great memories I have and keep. I will remember you and Matt forever. Take care and i will visit soon. Miss you Matt!! Xxx"

    "comment": "Hello everyone. This is just to let you all know that Michelle and Tamara have organised a group grief loss and trauma counselling session TONIGHT 28/4/06 at 4pm at the Tahmoor Health Centre (behind the Youth Centre. Please let anyone who you think may need a bit of help know about this session. Some people may be struggling alone and it will help them if they can talk to someone who deals with grieving. Some of us can cope to some degree and can let out their emotions and some cant and its these people who probably really need to talk and listen to someone suitably trained in this area. There will be a BBQ afterwards for those who attend, which is also a way of sharing feelings, etc.\n\nIt would be a good idea to ring Michelle on 4683 2776 or 0427 488 244 so she can make sure she has enough handouts and food available."

When I lost my Mum & Dad I found that the nights were the hardest to cope with & wouldve loved to have had somebody to just talk to.If you find that you cant sleep & need someone to listen, even if its 2,3 or 4am It wont matter just give me a call.Im a bit of a night owl anyway.It just might help to know that when your feeling down that theres someone that you can talk about Dave to at any hour, as I know I wouldve loved to have had someone to talk about Mum & Dad.So Please know that I am here & if it is what youd like to do...just pick up the phone and give me a call.\nId like to also say that I am so very very sorry that this had to happen to Dave as he is truly a very SPECIAL SON, BROTHER & FRIEND and is so very very missed by everyone that loves & knows him. Kindest Regards Gai"

Jumping up and down screaming with excitement.\nThrew me over your shoulder and sprinted the whole way to your car.\nI'll never forget your cheeky smile or your gorgeous eyes.\nI want to stop hurting so much but I cant.\nI always expect to see you drive past on your way to footy training. Or see you when i'm out somewhere.\nKnowing that it will never happen is to hard to take. I miss you Hamish. x"

There is certainly a need for you all to look out for each other. This is an easy solution to a complex situation. If it seems wrong, it probably is. Do not just accept it say something or do something. Look after each other. I like other parents and community members hope something positive comes from the night. If we only manage to save one it is better than doing nothing. There was some great ideas put forward for council to follow through on. Take care everyone."

Hey darl do you remember the time when we were supposed to be in some music concert one night at school, we got bored so we decided to wander the school and ended up setting off all the alarms and all the police came-oops, pretty fun though,i still claim it was your fault ofcourse, hehe.. wat i wouldnt give to be there again just to spend time with you. it really hurts me to know that your not coming back, not going to give me one more hug, not going to keep tellin me chin up sweety\" when things are getting tough, wish the pain would just go away. I always remember you use to do things to annoy me on purpose like if you were behind me in the canteen line ud think it would be funny to pick me up and put me behind you so you got there quicker -u cheeky bugger. il never forget you i promise there will always be a place in my heart for you, i never stop thinking bout you, luv ya always please watch over me and keep me safe luv you gorgeous xxx"

    "comment": "Today is a quiet day at work and I am finding myself thinking about things and feeling a bit down. Ive been reading some of the verses Ive found to try to cheer me up and found this one: HE IS GONE: You can shed tears that he is gone, Or you can smile because he lived, You can close your eyes and pray that he will come back, Or you can open your eyes and see all that he has left. Your heart can be empty because you cant see him Or you can be full of the love that you shared, You can turn your back on tomorrow and live yesterday, Or you can be happy for tomorrow because of yesterday. You can remember him and only that he is gone Or you can cherish his memory and let it live on, You can cry and close your mind be empty and turn your back, Or you can do what he would want: smile, open your eyes, love and go on. We do have our memories and can smile at some of the antics our boys got up to - but it is hard when all you want is to grab hold of them and give them a great big cuddle and tell them how much you love and miss them. Just also to let the Searles know Im thinking of them especially at this time. My love to everyone."

Mitch you mean more to me than words could even say. that special childhood bond that binded us closer and stronger everyday.

I quickly learnt a lot about Dave and the impact he had on the community, his family and friends.  Quite honestly, I am still coming to terms with the concept of someone so young having such a positive impact on so many people.  Deidre warned me to have tissues in hand if I logged on to this site....fool me for not listening!!!  And not only has David, but the other young people in the area who have so many friends and have affected so many people in their young lives.  I feel so sad now at all your losses and although I feel truly lucky for my wonderful family, the many comments above, have put clearly in perspective for me, the reality that being there for each other is one of the most important things you can do...to make no judgement and enjoy life!!  I will now go and wash my face, try to look like I havent cried for the last hour + and get ready to welcome my gorgeous husband and two beautiful children when they come home.  I am blown away that a collecion of complete strangers have impacted me so strongly and made a reality of what I so often say - but rarely do!!  Thank you.

His temprament, his appearance, his jet black hair, his big dimples and that smile that we loved sooo much from you has come back in him. Which i am truely grateful for.  I just needed to let you know that i am always thinking of you even though i don't go and see you i just can't do it.  i am truely grateful that i had you as a brother and that you were one of a kind and loved by so many people.  Just to let you know sean called Brody (your youngest nephew) FATTY the other day and i just burst into tears as that was my nickname for you and now that has been transfered to your nephew, i'm truely grateful for both my boys and knowing that you will always be looking from above and keeping an eye on them, they couldn't have wished for a better guardian angel.

    "comment": "Wow - Dave, Mitch, Hamish, Matt and Jack are so so lucky to have the friends they have.  I use present tense because I cannot seem to use past tense as they will all never leave us.  The tears have not been able to stop, reading everything that you have all said about the boys.\nI would like to thank Betty and Ross and Ian for all the help and support they have given us. Also all of Matt's friends - because without you guys Matt would not have been the person he was funny, gorgeous, cheeky, loving, serious,emotional, caring I could go on forever describing him (I am sure he would lov hearing all these things about himself) No it does not get easier it gets harder, I find Friday and Saturday nights really hard, as there is not the constant procession of friends in and out of the house of the constant use of  Matthews second favourite room in the house (the bathroom and the main thing in there of course was the mirror) is so so so quite.\nI miss opening the rumpus room door on Sunday morning and there was bodies everywhere. I miss all of you being there. I know I would do the normal mother things and rant and rave a bit, but I must have been doing something right as Matt said he never wanted to leave home\"-(he lied to me - I never never ever ever thought this would happen). I still see Dave standing in my kitchen with that beautiful smile and I miss Jack wandering in saying Hi Luce hows it going. I miss Matt saying looking good Luce or I luv you mum. I know on Mothers Day I brought one of the old cards he had brought me - as he got older he always brought me a really funny card.  Lucky I have kept all the cards he ever brought me (thats a thing mothers do) I remember laughing at Matt that night he had brought a new jacket with fur around the collar - what a girl!  I wish but I could have given him one more kiss, one more cuddle, I lie one more would not have been enough.  The photos have been sent to Ross of Matt and Jack. As I am typing this \"Three Wise Men\" are playing on the radio, I always think of Dave, Matt and Jack.\nYes there is a feeling of emptyness and there is a part of me missing, just like it is with all of you.  I am so so lucky that Matthew had such great, caring, fun loving friends.  Maybe you could write down some of the funny times you shared.  I am so pleased that some of the crazy things the boys did where videoed.  I was lucky enought to be a handed a video of Matt riding a push bike stark naked - (I wont say who the other person was - its our secret).  I haven't been able to sit down and watch all of it yet still too emotional, but I am so glad that some of these crazy things were videoed.\nIts funny I feel better writing on this site. \nIf anyone has any photos of the boys at all these parties they attened I would love to get them and do some copies as I would like to put something together for Karen and Wayne also.  If anyone has a photo of Matt in his Coles work shirt I would love to get a copy of it for his day. I am so proud of my son and also of the great friends he has - our family is always there for all of you. As a mother you can nearly fix everything but I hate this as I cannot change of fix it!!!!  Luv u Matt forever and ever Mum  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

    "comment": "Hey jacky baby, havnt posted for a while... it sometimes gets to the point where im lost for what to say..'im missing you' doesnt seem to be enough to describe what im feeling. over 4 months since u and matty have been gone, and no, time does not make it any easier. sometimes i jus sit and stare at photos of u and think.. i have done so much with u, i have shared so many memories, thoughts and dreams, and who can i talk to about all of that?? u cant talk about things shared jus between 2 people becuase they dont understand, they cant feel it.. only u could. i wonder so much if u can see me or hear me and then i get angry that u wont show me if u can.. i still sleep with ur pants and my 'jack doll' becuz i feel like a part of u is there with me in the night..and i ask u to hug me to sleep, i wonder if u do? its true that i will never be the same person that i was when u were alive, purely due to the fact that u were one of the biggest parts of my life, u affected the things i did, u inspired me so much that u will never know. i truely belive that i will never find another jack, how could i, there is no1 in the world like u.. and im glad becuz i would never ever want anyone to take ur place, and even when i am older and my life changes, there is one thing that will never change, and that is my love for you. i cant even begin to describe how lucky i feel that i got to be a part of your life.. i'll never forget the endless conversations, about nothing at all... i could talk to u for hours and hours and we would always be able to find something to keep talking about, half the time if we werent together we'd jus put on the same tv channel and watch tv while still bein on the phone, then comment on things that were happening. its hard not to cry when i think of you, and sometimes no matter what i jus lock myself in my room and scream and cry until i have no more energy to do anything else but fall to sleep. its like there is no escape from u, everywhere i go there is something stickin out with ur name on it, or something that u liked. i hate the fact i cant talk to u when im feelin like shit, but it seems these days that the only reason im feelin like that is becuz im missing u unbareably. i hope and pray so much that ur still around somewhere.. but no matter what ur not with me now and thats what hurts the most.i feel like i have learnt one of the hardest lessons that life has to give, life isnt great, life doesnt work out how u want it to, or think that it will.. and no matter what u cant control it or prevent it..it angers me that i have to do this, i look at people who dont have to feel this and im so envious.. but then i realise that there is so many people who have to feel like this, many that are feeling even worse and i dont know how they can, and atleast now i can understand the pain they have to go through.. im jus so greatful that u have the best family ever, and i know i cam go and cry with them anytime.. i think u were such a great person becuz of them jack and im sooo glad i get to still spend time with them becuz they make me feel close to u..i miss my convos with matt, i miss the way he would bag me out about my obsession with u! and he would always send me things from e-bay to check out haha, its hard bein around this town, without u two.. im envious of all the people who get to be with you now in heaven.. make sure u save a spot for me boys.  im always dreaming of you jack...i hope i never stop dreaming of you becuz its the only place that i can be with you. Love you so much XXX"

Now I definately know what they mean when they say something has a domino effect\", think of two rows of domino's going on and on on, one falls and the others keep falling, the number of lives effected by both the boys is incredible. Tasha my heart goes out to you, I know what it was like to loose someone you loved.  Just remember even if anyone tried to replicate what they had said or done even a few minutes ago it would never be the same thing, you have so so so many special memories, you are lucky because no one else has those same memories or feelings or moments of laughter only you and Jack had those. Jack is so so lucky to have your luv and Matt was a little shit for bagging you out,but you do know he liked stirring everyone, even though he was very sensitive, a side to him that I knew.  Our lives will never be the same and this town will never be the same, they talk about a water drought, boy over the years the Wollondilly area would have filled a huge huge dam for all the tears we have shed for the boys and girls we have lost in the area. Matt would be saying to me that's enough mum you are getting too sloppy.  Luv xxxxxxxxxx"

It seems so long ago that I could look through photos and get a buzz out of our kids enjoying themselves (and making everyone else around them laugh!)without that hollow emptiness underlying everything. Now I look at them and while I smile I wish more than anything on earth we could turn back the clock and change things!! \n..Somewhere in our dreams tonight we'll see you standing there, You look at us with a smile Life isn't always fair\". You say you were chosen for his garden, His preciously hand picked bouquet. \"God really needed us, That's why we couldn't stay\". It's said to be that angels Are sent from up above.

I know it wont n it will feel like this forever, but as long as i have your memories with me im sure i will get through. I just wish that i could have so many more memories with you, i wish you never left n would allways be with me, never in a million years could i immagine this horrible thing could happen.

If I knew it would be the last time that I see you walk out the door, I would give you a hug and kiss and call you back for one more If I knew it would be the last time I'd hear your voice lifted up in praise, I would video tape each action and word, \nso I could play them back day after day. If I knew it would be the last time,! I could spare an extra minute to stop and say I love you,\" instead of assuming you would KNOW I do. If I knew it would be the last time I would be there to share your day, Well I'm sure you'll have so many more, so I can let just this one slip away. For surely there's always tomorrow to make up for an oversight, and we always get a second chance \nto make everything just right. There will l always be another day to say \"I love you,\" And certainly there's another chance to say our \"Anything I can do?\" But just in case I might be wrong, and today is all I get, I'd like to say how much I love you and I hope we never forget. Tomorrow is not promised to anyone, young or old alike, And today may be the last chance you get to hold your loved one tight So if you're waiting for tomorrow, why not do it today? For if tomorrow never comes, you'll surely regret the day, That you didn! 't take that extra time \nfor a smile, a hug, or a kiss and you were too busy to grant someone, what turned out to be their one last wish. So hold your loved ones close today, and whisper in their ear, Tell them how much you love them and that you'll always hold them dear Take time to say \"I'm sorry,\" \n\"Please forgive me,\" \"Thank you,\" or \"It's okay.\" \nAnd if tomorrow never comes, you'll have no regrets about today. \n\nLife is to short we have all lost so much i hope this is a little reminder for people to cherish what was and what is.\nJen xoxo"

I just wish things were so much different. You guys were the ones we always looked out for when we went out to a party or anywhere. The ones that would make any girl smile, and everyone LAUGH, yous had amazing personalities each one of you had something different and special about you that made us love you as much as we do. Our lives have been left with holes, but I am so glad to have met you all and shared some memories with you, not as many as I would have liked but hey, I'll see yas again, we all will. To the Andrew Family we are thinking of you guys at this time. We love you guys. Stay Strong- by the way Happy 21st Ian, I hope you were ok and had a good day. LOVE you DILLY BOYS!!! Take care everyone. Lots of Love... Xxx"

For anyone who can get their hands on the 9th October Womans Day have a look on one of the pages a couple in from the back and you will see Davids double. Ask Dean Wall my reaction when he showed me, I almost collapsed, I thought it WAS David. I surprised Ian with a flying visit for his 21st which was on Tuesday. He is living in a nice part of the world at the moment. My love to everyone."

Youre right it does't get any easier and we just have to make it through the best way we can. It never ceases to amaze me the impact the 4 guys had on so many people - their sense of humour and the fun times they had, their love of life and for the people around them, thats what helps us through knowing that they made the best of the time they had here. We are all the better for having them in our lives. To the rest of my family thank you and I love you all."

I hope you guys can make it so I can have a chat with you for the paper and we can let people know how devastating it is to lose a close friend or family member on our roads. It doesn't seem like two years since Mike rang me with the bad news about Dave. Still gives me goose bumps when I think about it - I can still hear his voice and remember every single word he said. I am continually amazed by the way you guys have pulled through everything you have been through. Not many kids your age have suffered the terrible loss you guys have. It's not fair that some people don't know what it's like to lose one friend, but you guys have lost more friends in two years than our parents have in a lifetime. I am truly amazed by your courage and I'm so proud of you. I know the boys would be proud as well. Keep looking after each other and stay safe ok. chelle xx"

Twenty three years has gone to fast I never never expected it would only be 23 years I thought it would have been forever. If only I had a few minutes more I would have told you we loved you more than all the stars in the sky,fish in the sea, with mu whole heart and soul that is how much I will love you always and forever.I know you knew you were loved and you always said you would never leave home-we must not have been too bad a parents then -we all miss you so so so much. You are remembered by so many people that was shown today with the phone calls, birthday bloons, flowers, cards, raising of glasses.  The love that has been felt for you today is so overwelming.  You are so lucky that you have so many fabulous friends and family. We could not have got through today without Jacks family, Tahnee, all your precious fantastic friends, and of cause all your family.\nThank you everyone. xxxxxxxxxxxx our three wise men are shinning in the southern cross tonight."

I guess its cos the Dilly has the best boys but i think enough is enough. Its too many. I hate this. I remember the day Davey left the whole town just stopped. And its been happening a lot since then. I hate seeing the boys with teary eyes and so hurt- Why can't they just leave our boys alone? Why does this keep happening? Just when we think that the year is nearly over and nothing can go wrong it does, it goes terribly wrong. My heart is with the Keating Family, you raised a good kid. a great kid. He was gonna go to Europe for god sake. Its the ones that have dreams and go for them that leave, the ones we love and care about so much. Then agan we love all our Dilly. I just want this to stop. When will it end? I know its not their fault, its the ones above that can't stop taking our boys. This is just so unfair. Its Christmas and now we are saying good bye to another precious life taken from us too soon. My heart is with all of you guys... To the Keating Family i am so sorry bout this, My love to you all. Rest In Peace Matt Keato\" Keating... We will love you forever and you will be dearly missed, you will be in our thoughts everyday with the rest of our DILLY BOYS.!!!!! xox With love. xox"

There is nothing fun about this, but someone up there thinks its okz to take the people we love, BUT IT ISNT... Its MEAN! And its so unfair. Their families shouldnt have to say goodbye, or to feel this pain, this emptiness, not yet. Not now. Their friends shouldnt be left here crying. Wishing just one more time. Just one more Hi, one more hug, laugh, smile. Why won't it just end? Why can't these things just STOP. I am sick of it all. I am sick of seeing the boys upset. I am sick of all the Funeral notices. ITS JUST NOT RIGHT, NOT FAIR. Why is our DILLY getting smaller? Why is it the good ones leaving us? Why are the bad ones here still hurting us? Life just doesnt make sense sometimes. it realli doesnt. There are TOO MANY HOLES IN OUR LIVES now. TOO MANY! He was going places that boy was.

I dont think there would be a greater bunch of kids who are friends around the WORLD who have had to suffer the ongoing tragedies in their short lives, let alone those of us who are older seeing our kids having to try to cope with all their losses. Life seems so unfair at times! As Ross has said PLEASE RING US IF ANYONE NEEDS TO TALK!!\nI didnt see Keato all that often but I do have 2 memories - the first at David's 18th when I went up to him after he said hello to me and I said  Im sorry, which one of Dave's friends are you\", to which he replied \"Im one of the Rally twins\", but I knew he was taller than either of those boys. And the last time I spoke to him was at Jason's funeral a few weeks ago when we simply looked at one another and I said to him something like \"Lets hope this is the last funeral we have for one of our boys\". Unbelievable!\n\nTo all our kids left here who have again got to try to cope with a sudden tragic loss, my heartfelt sympathies to you all and if there is anything I can do to help please get in touch.\n\nTo Mathew's family please accept my sincere condolences and as with the kids if I can be of any help please let me know.\n\nMy love to everyone."

Last time i saw you was a few weeks ago , and you had that horrible moustache, and u kept saying  hey tash, Me scuzi...\" and i runup n gav u a hug, and that was my last. i remember how u wasted all my credit tryin to ring my brother on ur 21st, cuz u wanted him to come to ur party and when he finally got there u were in ur room, pretty much passed out but you were so happy to see him, he respects you so much n we both think your the biggest champ. your goin to be missed more than youll ever know by so many people. im so sorry to keatos family, i wish i could take your pain away but nothing anyone says could ease the hurt you are all feeling now. to all the boys, im so sorry another one of you has gone, and it sucks more than words can express...

If you need to talk, cry and or even just come and see us and not say anything we are there for you all!!!!! To Keato's family we know the pain your going through. Going to see them on Sunday was so so hard and we realised how everyone that came to see us must have fealt not knowing what to say, but without all the support of the family, prescious friends and the Dilly it would have been so much harder.  When I walked into Keato's house and the first person I saw was Cheryl (Keato's Aunty) who I know that was so hard and hearing that they had lost a 17 year old neice not long ago was worst.  We know that Dave, Matt and Jack and his cousin will be there for Keato.\nThe pain of watching you all hurting so so much is unbearable. I wish you all did not have to suffer like you all are. As parents we love you all so much never forget that.  We only try to protect you all. Love to everyone"

I remember how I conned Mum to give me the car. Special favor\" I pleaded \"All the kids drive\". When the three fifteen bell rang I threw my books in a locker. Free until tomorrow morning. I ran to the car park excited with the thought of driving the car and being my own boss. Doesn't matter how the accident happened; I was showing off going too fast, taking crazy chances. I was enjoying my freedom and having fun. The last thing I remember was passing an old lady who seemed to be going awfully slow. (crash sound effect) I heard a crash, a terrific jolt. Glass and steel flew everywhere. My whole body seemed to be turning inside out, I heard myself scream. (scream sound effect).\n\nSuddenly, I awakened. It was very quiet, a policeman was standing over me. I saw a doctor; my body was mangled, I was saturated in blood. Pieces of jagged glass were sticking out all over. Strange, that I couldn't feel anything. \"Hey, don't put that sheet over my head I can't be dead, Im only 17. I've got a date tonight, I'm supposed to have a wonderful life ahead of me, I'm about to leave school, I haven't lived yet. I can't be... dead.\"\n\nLater I was placed in a draw at the morgue; my parents came to identify me. Why did they have to see me like this? Why did I have to look at my mum's eyes when she faced the most terrible ordeal of her life. Dad suddenly looked very old. He told the man in charge \"Yes that's my daughter\". \n\nThe funeral was weird, I saw all my relatives and friends walk toward the casket. They looked at me with the saddest eyes I've ever seen. Some of my friends were crying. A few of the girls touched my hand and sobbed as they walked past.\n\n\"Please, somebody wake me up get me out of here. I can't bear to see Mum and Dad in such pain. My grandparents are so weak with grief they can hardly walk, my brother and sister like zombies they move like robots, in a daze.\"\n\nEverybody; no one can believe this. I can't believe it either. \n\n\"Please don't bury me, Im not dead, I have a lot of living to do. I want to laugh and run again, I want to sing and dance. Please don't put me in the ground. I promise if you give me just one more chance God I'll be the most careful driver in the whole world. All I want is one more chance. Please God, I'm only 17.\""

To Mario, thank you for what you have said. The tragedies our kids have had to face is something we would never wish on our worst enemies. We are so proud of the kids, they have shown and due to circumstances beyond their control are still showing the greatest strengths and bonds and that is the positive that comes out of this 'hell on earth' situation that we have all been dealt. What other area and group of kids has had to pull through ongoing tragedies over a 2 year period. As mentioned by a few people here, at 18 I hadn't faced the loss of any friends or even acquaintances- life and the future was good. \n\nI take my hat off to all you kids for the love and friendship you have shown each other. You are there to help each other when times are tough and you know we mums and dads are here if you need us.\n\nPlease take care over the holiday period. Your future is ahead of you, don't ever take things for granted. You all have so much to look forward to.\n\nMy love to everyone, and I know I will always be thankful for this site - to read the great messages and to be able to contribute has been a way of healing for me.

I hate that this has happened, i hate that we have no control and we're just spose to keep going. There is no justice for the amount of pain we have all gone through these last few years. I'm so thankful that i have my friends to help me through all of this but it also makes me wonder... How long will they be there for?\nWhat if this all just keeps happening. Is this what happens in life? You make friends and unbeleivable bonds with people, you grow with them, love them and then its all taken away. Gone.\nIt's just so pointless. I love you boys and i'm missing you every day. Please take care of each other and remember we love you forever.\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"

Working in Sydney people usually dont know where Picton or the Dilly is but i think that kind of adds to the beauty of it. \nI love that we dont have people all over the place and we have our own space to do our thing.\nAnyway the point is I love you guys. every one of you."

Would you still be going to Cronulla and come home scratched to bits from the reef? Would you be a qualified carpenter? Would you still have your sideburns down to your chin? All these questions, but one thing I know for sure is that everyones life would be so much better if you were still here - you never ever knew how important you were to people and how many of us wished we had your sense of humour and ability to make people laugh (our lives are so much the better for your being here!) And now its your birthday on the 4th, you would have been 23. David we miss you so much and my tears are starting all over again just wishing we could celebrate your birthday with you here. We will be looking up at your star and sending our love. \nHave the best birthday you can have with all those other loved ones with you now and keep everyone smiling. My love to you all."

I remember one of our boys telling me that David was his 'pitcrew' and he (David) got introduced to one of the other well known riders at a meeting. Next meeting this particular rider remembered David but not the rider who he was helping out! (If that makes sense.) He is remembered in so many ways - his build (big Dave!), his beautiful black hair, his flashy smile, his wonderful sense of humour (which got him into trouble sometimes), his crazy antics - the list goes on and on..... Not many of us will be remembered and thought of every day like our beautiful boys here. Their effect on so many people of all ages will never cease to amaze me. The memories we have and the great times will keep their spirits alive forever. These kids will NEVER be forgotten and our lives are all the richer for knowing and loving them to bits."

You were my sanity I miss you so much!!\nAll you boys know how I was always telling him to put his shoes away that use to be at the front door well the pair of shoes he wore on the satureday night and then came home and changed into his sleeps are still at my front door waiting for him to come through that door and wear them again- If ony I wouldnot care if there were 50 pairs of shoes at the front door as long as I had my mouse back.\nI want to thank all of you for your love and support - it was great seeing you all on Anzac day -the one person missing was Grant - I could not believe he was not there - I missed you.  Has Grant given up partying? What I have learnt is that we have to enjoy every minute of everyday andlive it like its your last.  My life has changed forever.  \nKaren and Wayne and Allan and I have said we wish we would have socialised when our boys were here, I know they were always saying we would enjoy each others company and its so true -  I feel that we are not just friends they are part of our\nfamily for the rest of our lives.\nI know Matthew is around me I often feel like he is standing in the kitchen (of cause he would be in the kitchen he loved his food).\nOne thing I do know a broken heart can never be healed. we will get old but Matt and Jack will be forever young.

These are some of the toughest times. From a mother - we aren't supposed to have our children taken away from us! We have helped them grow - seen them through sad and happy times and just when you think they are 'all grown up'and the future looks OK, something beyond your control takes them away. I have said this before, thank you for this site and Shane all your mates are here for you.

For us we miss the nights when you would all arrive to go out and you would be waiting (some not so patiently) for Matt to get ready.  I really miss opening the rumpus room door on a Sunday morning and wondering who had crashed at our place that night- I dont think you all realise how much I really miss that Jack had the right idea now I know why he would always walk in with two drinks, he would patiently wait for Matt to get changed at least ten times a night.  I miss seeing the esks left at the front door (some still with some left over grog in them) you use to always seem to collect them by the end of the day.  We know how you are all feeling they were your friends and you had great times with them - you all have your own special memories.  I am afraid it is not getting any easier if any thing its getting harder. One thing Matt and Jack would be pleased about is that the Parker and Lye families have become family, they always said that we would of all got on fantastic -well this is certainly the case. I was saying to Matts dad today - Matt loved the Dilly so much I could not imagine moving away from here and all the fantastic people that live here.  The other day I ran into one of Matts old friends from Aussie Rules, the first question he asked me was how Matt was and how he was such a good Aussie Rules player - I had to hold back the tears and tell him what happened as he had been away and did not know.  Anyway my heart goes out to the families who more recently have lost a loved one.  \nNaz thank you for doing this site you are fantastic and a great friend to the boys.  Naz is you that drives the ute that looks similar to Matts?   Luv to you all and the doors always open.  Also to Feno happy 21st I will catch up with you soon.  Lucy and the Lye Family xxxxx"

Mattys hair always looked better than mine and Jack always had something smart to say and Davey ohhh jus everything about him, i still have a huge smile on my face whenever i think about him! Ian i have to say you remind me of him a lot. Sometimes you'll pull a face n it'l be his. All of our DILLY BOYS are awesome, from smiles to laughs and from the first day we met you to the last time we saw you, yous amazed us in every way possible! The families of these boys ought to be so proud of the boys they have raised because I must say if my children turn out half as great as them i will be so proud! I know that where ever i go i have 5 great guardian angels watching over everyone in the Dilly! I think with all the boys put together they wud have known almost ALL of the Dilly! I am so greatful to have known them. I love you all so very much, and miss you everyday more and more. It isnt getting easier but i am learning how to deal with it by turning my tears of sadness into tears of laughter...

I just love to read the ways in which David has left his mark on people - people who I don't even know. David was a bugger at school, a teacher's nightmare, but he was fortunate to have that great personality and 'harmless' nature that you couldn't take offence and couldn't stay angry for too long. He would just give you one of his looks and you would crack up laughing.\nI wanted to let you know that I had a dream with David in it last night. I was sitting next to one of his mates and Grant Fairley was down the road. I waved at him and saw David with him and he waved back. I asked the person (I can't remember who it was)next to me if he could see David and he said no. The next thing David was walking past me (with dreadlocks and clean shaven - looking about 18)and I asked him where he was going and he said just going bmx riding\" and I just told him to be careful. That was it - I woke up, but it seemed so real...anyway, just wanted to tell you.\n\nMy love to everyone and remember if any of you have memories of our boys, us mums like to read them after all they probably spent more time with mates than at home (David did, anyway!)\n\nAlso, if anyone has or knows of anyone who may have videos, etc., with David (be it at parties, riding, or whatever) please let me know as Ross is putting all that we have together on a dvd.

I try not to think about losing peope I care about so much which probably isn't the best way to deal with this.Jack and Keato, knew you both since we were kids we had lots of fun,Keato you were the only guy to every slap me in the face lol. Searley u were entertainment and a very genuine person.Matt... I had never lost someone I was so close to in my life until losing you. I still laugh about you blaming me to your friends on us being late one nightwhen really it was you hairspraying your hair in place for forty minutes in the bathroom and then hearing Lucy yelling at you for using all her good hairspray.You were the first person I fell in love with, and we stayed friends ever since. I'm sorry Lucy and Allan that I haven't come around its not that I don't want to,I just find it hard. I have lots to say to you but don't want to walk in the front door and start crying again.I see alan all the time fixing up the flags down my road and spending time there and wanting to stop to give him a hug. I hope you are all well Isabella must be getting big now! I think about you all all the time...all my love renee xxxxx"

People hav told me that time will heal all the pain I and everyone else is feeling, but I am not sure it will because now i think about you and it just reminds me of how long ago it was since i last spoke to you or saw u smile or seen you driving past! I was just sitting down in my room the other day and I was thinking about how long it has been since we had seen you last and remembering all the memories that i and evryone kno and share with you and i just started to cry! I know that you are still floating around watching over your family and close friends but i just wish we could see you! I wont say just one more time because i am being selfish i want it to be more than one more i want you to be here all the time like you used to be. Its just not the same. Time will never heal the emptiness in our lives no matter what anyone will say, Dave you are irreplaceable. \nSometimes i sit and wish i could just talk to you, hug you or even just sit there and look at you, just to have you in my presence. Your an angel. I thank you for being a part of my life and letting me be a part of yours. I love you xox. I miss you! Please come back home and bring our Matt, Jack, Mitch, Keato back with you.

I have just read a few words that one mum who has lost 3 little children has on a pillow in her home and it has brought me to tears. It says A mother holds her children's hands for a while, their hearts forever\". How true she is. I can't even begin to comprehend how losing 3 children would feel - sometimes I wonder if we could feel any deeper sadness, but I am sure that this poor mum is feeling it 3 times over.\n\nI am going to see a lady next Monday who I am hoping will connect with David...I will keep you posted."

    "comment": "Well, the medium had alot to say. She actually reached my mum, dad and sister first and was pretty accurate - even told me my dad was holding up his hands in front of her and had the top of his finger missing, which he did! She didn't pick up riding bikes and doing stunts etc with David but picked up on other stuff. She saw how he had the accident, but I won't go into detail - I felt better after I listened to her. She is actually the third person to tell me the first person to be waiting for him was an older man and the second person to tell me he was working with the children (helping the 8-12 with basketball and rounders - even though this sounds a bit over the top). She saw him to be good looking, dark haired with a great smile and a big belly laugh. She told me that David wanted me to smile again and to 'get on with it'- which he used to say to me, but actually 'get over it'. I have it all on tape and will listen to it over and over. I am glad I saw this lady - the hurt and emptiness will never go away but there seem to be too many coincidences for there not to be something else after we pass. Thank you to all of you for your messages."

If youre driving be extra careful on the roads and take care with whatever you are doing.\n\nI had a visit recently from Darren Moon, the policeman who attended David's accident. It wasnt until we spoke last week that I fully realised the ongoing emotional problems of having to be the person to tell families of tragedies. Darren has been struggling with the guilt of having to be the one to tell our family about David and I was so upset and felt helpless knowing that I couldn't help him through a really tough time. We need to always remember  the policemen, ambos, rescuers etc who have deal with traumatic situations day in day out and Darren we thank you for being there for us 3 years ago....I just wish I could help you now...

The heavens have opened up today and it seems the raindrops count for all the tears that have fallen over the past 3 and a bit years. David we miss you more than ever and not a day goes by that we don't think of you. I am sending you all our love to you on your birthday. You were such a character and not a day went by when you were here that you didn't put a smile on someone's face. You made so many people's lives so much better having you around and those memories we will have forever. I have a poem for you David which I send with all my love:\nTheres a special Angel in Heaven that is a part of me. It is not where I wanted him, but where God wanted him to be. He was here but just a moment like a night time shooting star. And though he is in Heaven, he isn't very far. He touched the hearts of many like only Angels can. I would've held him every minute if I'd only known God's plan. So I send this special message to the Heavens up above. Please take care of my Angel and send him all my love. Mum."

I see so much of you in your little nephew 'Byron Mathew Keating' who will get told about the wonderful person you were and what a wonderful uncle you would have been and possibly still are as we know you will forever be watching over him. Your dad and your brothers ,Rob and Phil miss you greatly and wish you were still here, but realise that you'll be with them forever.Nothing can ever fill the void in our lives but through the love and support from all of your mates and theirs and our families we are learning to try and cope a little better. And to all our other lost dilly boys and girls families i now know how difficult and sad it is to lose such a cherished  part of your family.all our love always,to our beautiful son mat, forever in our hearts mum, dad phil,rob,becka,byron,sam,cody and marve. and to all your mates  im so sorry you lost such a great mate in keato."

I have tried a couple of times to leave thoughts but havent had any luck.\n\nDavid would have been 25 last month, so hard to even comprehend that. I wonder often what he would be like - would he still be the fun-loving crazy person we all loved...I would hope so. And would he bring smiles to everyone's faces and make people laugh...yes, he would have never lost that wonderful trait!\n\nIan will be moving to Canberra shortly to work and is going on a short holiday to Tassie soon and hoping to catch up with one of the Rally (?) twins while there. Deirdre is having another baby, due September...I know David would be still asking havent you brought a TV yet?\" Others all OK. Jackson and Bailey started school this year and so far so good.\n\nI hope you are all doing well in whatever youre doing, and thank you again for fixing the site up."

In time more and more people will realise that Ryan has fixed the problem..I know when I spoke with Ross over Easter he didnt realise it was working again. We can never thank you enough Ryan. There are so many of us who think about our boys countless times during each day and I myself find this site a wonderful way of helping get me through. My love to everyone."

I swear Dave i heard your voice the other night, 2am i was up couldn't sleep. So silent in the house where my little family are sleeping, i turned the kettle on for a warm milo, and i heard you say hi sweety\" It was perfect, i know i didn't imagine it as right at that moment i was thinking about something different. it shocked me, took my breath away, bought me to tears and made me smile. It is the first time in a long time since i have felt you with me. I think about you every single day and i drift away to alot of precious moments we shared. It always makes me smile. As time goes on i have learnt to live without you, but the pain of having to is endless. I still wish i could just see you for one moment, to hug you, just to let you know how much i love you. life is going well for me but without you in my life it isn't complete. Miss you dave, rest in peace my beautiful angel."
