And you know what, it aint often that you will find someone and no matter who you are or who you hang around, you could always be their mate. Moments shared with you were always good times!

You don\'t have to ever worry that we will never stop thinking of you...unless we\'re thinking of what the time is, or where the fuck we left our keys, but really, you have left a massive impression on everyone you\'v ever met.

Goodbyes are much to strong a word
for goodbyes are forever and never reoccur
this is just a temporary part
we will soon meet again but until then,
you will always be remembered in my heart
i think of you all the time
i wish sometimes i could just rewind,
and be there when you needed a hand,
help you when you could not stand,
be there in your time of need
how could someone just let you leave,
I\'m sorry this had to happen to you
such a young boy, i cant believe this to be true
my eyes filled with tears of sadness when i heard
such news to me, it seemed unreal and so absurd
it hasn\'t hit me yet,
that your gone for real, but you had no regrets
you lived your life to the fullest everyday
and you didn\'t let troubles get in your way
that is what i loved about you
no one could replace a person like you,
so beautiful inside and out
how could god take you away? 
never did i really say, how much i loved you so,
I\'m telling you now and yes its true
I Love you xxx<br><hr><br><b>Amanda</b><br>Im never going to forget your smile, you were one of the only people iv known that had a smile on there face 247, you were a gift to know and you will always have a place in my heart, ill miss you  xxxxxx<br><hr><br><b>Mick</b><br>We only met a couple of times, but even those few times u made a huge impression; not just on myself, but pretty much everyone you have ever met it seems.
Dave must have been one of the most loved guys I know. Virtually everyone knew him, and everyone had nothing but praise, admiration & respect for him. 
You\'ll be sadly missed, though never forgotten.
RIP Dave<br><hr><br><b>monique</b><br>I only met dave a few times but my memories of him are only good ones. He always made everyone around him laugh and i can remember when i saw him at partys he\'d have a can in one hand.. the other on his hip and a huge big smile on his face. When i heard about what had happened i couldnt believe it and still cant. You didnt deserve this dave you have so many friends that love u so much and will continue to until forever. u will never be forgotten and always have a place in our hearts. i\'ll miss u xx<br><hr><br><b>emma</b><br>Dave,you were obviously a blessing to every single one of your friends and your presence will be greatly missed by so many kids.

This guy was\\is amazing. His ability to make someone laugh in the worst of times was incredible. I know the times down at the skatepark or trails where Dave was always found will never be forgotten, Just like every other moment i remember. He was one of those guys that looked after everyone. It would be impossible to live up to Dave. He was\\is the best guy that ever walked. Cant wait to see u again champ.

We have seen so many accidents like this in our area, and not one has hit or effected such a large number of people as this has. Over the last few days we have seen so many of Daves friends and family go to any lengh to do things the way Dave would have wanted. It really does show how great he was. Dave really was what made and broke what we all know as the Dilly. I will never forget the great times I have shared with Dave as I am sure most of us will remember them. When I think of Dave I just see that big smile of his that he did as he would pull his head back, it was one of a kind, in fact so was he. I have known Dave ever since we were really young and he has always been a big brother to everyone he knew. He will be missed dearly by everyone. If we learnt something from Dave it would have been... To live life for today and not for tomorrow dont have regrets do what you want to do and dont wait.We all love you, you wont be forgotten. x x x<br><hr><br><b>luke walker</b><br>hey everyone if anyone wants to ride with the crew on friday to the funeral meet at my house at 9 or abit after respect.............<br><hr><br><b>luke walker</b><br>i love u dave, respect forever.......dilly boy 4 life.........<br><hr><br><b>I Am Number 1</b><br>Really great guy fuckin champion, fully sick rider,<br><hr><br><b>deon (again)</b><br>i forgot to say before that dave could not have wished for better friends in the world. you guys have done your best to pull together at the worst time. your gettin a hell of a lotta respect and as sad it is that you had to pull together for this reason i rekon dave\'s lookin down with a tear in his eye cuz i don\'t reckon he knew he meant so much to so many people but he did. my hat goes off to you guys. i\'ll see you friday an if i can do anything for anyone, please let me know <br><hr><br><b>No Name</b><br>A rose once grew where all could see, sheltered beside a garden wall.
And, as the days passed swiftly by, it spread its branches, straight and tall.

One day, a beam of light shone through a crevice that had opened wide.
The rose bent gently toward its warmth then passed beyond to the other side.

Now, you who deeply feel its loss, be comforted, the rose blooms there.
Its beauty even greater now, nurtured by God\'s own loving care.

i\'ve known dave since back in the day playing junior soccer together, and even back then he was the kinda kid you knew was gonna grow up to be someone awesome, and he was to everyone. I didn\'t get to hang out much with him during highschool but when i did see him at parties or whatever we\'d hang out and catch up and that was awesome, just so damn friendly to everyone. Rest easy Dave and we\'ll all see you again<br><hr><br><b>Jess</b><br>Although Dave was only with us for a short time, he made the biggest impression and touched so many peoples lives.

I know that I will

Open up the gates for me
Reminisce sometime the night they took my friend
Try to black it out, but it plays again
When it\'s real feelings hard to conceal
Can\'t imagine all the pain I feel
Give anything to hear half your breath

R.I.P my brother, untill the next time we meet, keep on partying and smiling along the way. love you dave, i will never forget you.Christopher James Roche.<br><hr><br><b>Cameron Charles Bishop</b><br>through my eyes
He was a kid which would stick up for his mates even tho he knew he was gunna get smashed.he was a kid who had a personal thing with everbody.a kid how loved a great feed at the grecko.a kid who would giggle just befor a grash on his bike and get up laughing even though the pain would be real bad.a kid who would buy a car cause it looks pimp and let it brake down and borrow the family car untill he got round to fixing his.a kid who had the same clothes on everytime he rode(denum shorts white socks blue bonds undies and shirt/no shirt).a kid that would go out of his way to make sure you were happy and if you werent he would pull a sad face and give you a tikkle and it would always cheer you up.a kid that would stick to his word.a kid that didnt like text msgs(he would say just fukin ring me).a kid that would hold his head high through tuff times.a kid that never cared about money(you only live once bishop).a kid that was pround of a rum flop(like sucking on a boneless pinky).a kid that was never scared to get it out and angry.a kid that was not scared to walk home from anywere(lucky your house is on the way bishop wasnt lookin forward to walkin to bargo).a kid that wasnt scared to say i love you to his mates.well dave i love you Through my eyes dave you were everything that i wanted to be.Dave i hope i never let you down.If i do give me a sign and a kick up the ass.....peace out  <br><hr><br><b>Ash</b><br>Dave..
Each day that comes along i hope to see you just one more time,
to share one more laugh, to want one last hug.
Each day i wish we were given a chance to say goodbye, to share one more moment and have one last giggle before you were taken away.
But i know if we were given that chance, we wouldn\'t say goodbye or have one last laugh together. We would all hold onto you forver so it would be impossible to lose you.
Today, Tomorrow, and each day after that, memories shared with you will always be held close to our hearts.
xoxo<br><hr><br><b>Rosanna</b><br>Reading all this makes me realise even more how much dave had a huge effect on everyone he met. It is still hard to believe such a great guy is no longer with us. Even though i did not know him as well as others, alot of my childhood memories have him in it. Growing up in Bargo in the same street for 14 years with someone does mean alot to ppl around here. I will miss seeing him outside his house or Chris\'s house waving like crazy at me just to get a giggle out of me or even a smile. I remember him most for that, making ppl laugh. Dave we will miss you, it won\'t be the same without you, the loss of you has brought so much sadness but left alot of happy memories to remember you by. No one deserves this, especially you. All my sympathy goes to your parents, brothers, sister and to shannon xoxo<br><hr><br><b>matt</b><br>jesus, i don\'t know this guy at all but I ride a pushy and sometimes check out this website

all i can say is hang in there you guys, i\'m sure your mate dave would want you to cary on strong!

he sounds like a champion bloke and i hope he rests in peace<br><hr><br><b>Larissa & Ebony</b><br>My deppest regards to the andrews family and all friends envolved around dav. Its sad to see such a young innocent life gone but im sure everyone agrees that he wont be forgotten.

We live in New Zealand and unfortunatly did\'nt get to spend much time with him but your kind words help us to understand the tragic loss. Our love to all those suffering.<br><hr><br><b>English Cousins</b><br>

NOT just a name on the bottom of a Christmas card or a face on the occasional photo - David was clearly loved and respected by so many.  

We never really got to know him well - just a few weeks in \'97 of shared meals and family get-togethers \' a brief chance to meet all our cousins from Oz.  

We can see that we missed out on the special friendship and love that he gave to you all.  
We hope that through the tears and the pain that David\'s laughter will shine through.

Our love goes to Betty & Ross, Russ, Diedre, Ian; Shannon and all his relatives and special friends. 

David Neil Andrews - An inspiration to us all.

<br><hr><br><b>emma n jessica!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</b><br>we didnot know you but we here so much stuff about you, may you rest in  peace by the way you were loved my many expcially by picton hight kids they all miss you..
<br><hr><br><b>Just Us!!!!!!!</b><br>It is those who were not fortunate enough to have their lives touched by Dave that have missed out in all of this. He has brightened the lives of so many people in so many ways. Dave was a hero to all that knew him, he lived his life like there was never going to be a tomorrow.

Dave would not want us to mourn his death, but to celebrate his life and live our own lives just as he did, to the fullest. Our hearts and thoughts go out to Dave\'s friends and family. Dave you will be forever in our hearts.<br><hr><br><b>squiz </b><br>dude being at the funral today ripped me to peaces i dont think i can ever say goodbye to you man cause i dont want to beleive it, i\'ve had a few rums for you today for you dude looking at your pictures today brought back alot of memories of how good it was to be around you. As i sit here drunk now im ok but ill wake up tomorro and realise that i wont be seeing you for a fuking long time and i dont know if i can cope with that i only wish you would just turn up again with your big cheesy smile and give me a swipe i miss ya dude and this is somthing that i wont get over for a fuking long time.i just dont understand why you didnt deserve this but i guess if i ever need to find ya you will be at bargo cemetry R.I.P dude and i will cya again one day 
<br><hr><br><b>Yue</b><br>I want to give all my best wishes to the Andrews family. You guys made Dave who he was. I\'ve never seen a family so close in my life. It\'s everything and more that i could ever wish for. You guys are bloody legends. And unlike most circumstances, we didn\'t need this tragedy to show us that. We already knew. If the boys are gona get together and organise something we can do annually for Dave, I\'ll be there. I know no one will ever forget him, but Dave was worth so much more then just not to be forgotten... So much more... The funeral was exactly how Dave would\'ve wanted it.. I guess just not so soon. I\'m happy to know the amount support you have behind you. And why not, you guys more then deserve it.. To the Andrews family..Thankyou<br><hr><br><b>ColMal & Tiff</b><br>Theres nothing more to say than what everyones already said .. u were the absolute best guy ANYONES ever met! If theres beer up there, make sure you save some for the others.

UR Dearly Missed DAVE!! Love ColMal & Tiff xoxo

<b>No Name</b><br>Who wrote the story of Dave that was handed out at the funeral? It was beautiful and im curious as to who wrote it because it mentions \'i\' alot.. ?<br><hr><br><b>Ryann Galea</b><br>Dave you were the best guy ever and if this wasnt enough to prove it, today definately was, evryone loves you man and we will keep on forever.. your personality is embedded in me for life and im going to keep that way.. You are unforgetable and i love you so much, You are a true brother to evryone, WeRide For Life! Dilly For Life.. Rest in peace David Andrews Love your black brother Narz....<br><hr><br><b>No Name</b><br>We dont know why things like this happen, nor do we understand it.What makes it so much harder is the person who this has happened to. How can we justify someone dying at 20yrs old..how can we justify such a great, amazing and loving person, like Dave leaving us all?
There aren\'t words to describe the feeling, nor are there words to make everything better.. there is only the hope, that the lump in your throat, and the pain in your heart will ease in time. 
To a truley amazing person who will remain in our hearts for all eternity..Dave Andrews..<br><hr><br><b>Chris Harti</b><br>I no iv never met u by all these comments u seem like pretty cool guy so rest in peace dave never stop rideing man peace out.<br><hr><br><b>Jessica Collin</b><br>When I saw the accident I never thought it would be someone I knew. You have been such a great friend to ADAM and he is missing you so much.
I am hopeing you are in a safe place now and being the silly man you were, making everyone laugh, making everyone have fun, and just being such a great friend.
We all will never forget you, and we will always miss you loveable heart.
This is not good bye its just see you later, and I am sure when we all see you again we will have the fun that we always have when we are with you.
Love Always
Jess xxoo
 <br><hr><br><b>michelle</b><br>Dave, just wondering if u were having a laugh at all of us standing in the rain today?? Funny how the rain did stop shortly after the funeral!! Ur a very funny man.. It was amazing to see so many people united today, what a reflection of who Dave is and what he will always be capable of.
(narz,thanks for the site and the time to share)
<br><hr><br><b>another part of  \"Just Us !!!!!!!\"</b><br>I never met this lad but it is clear from this page that he was one hell of a man in the making.  My heart goes out to his family and friends, especially Dean, please know you have a friend thinking of you through this very rough time.<br><hr><br><b>!!!!!!!!!!!!</b><br>The story about Dave that was handed out at the funeral was put together by Stuart Roche and some of his closest and dearest friends. It was the most beautiful thing I have ever read. CONGRATS GUYS !!!!! It was excellent and to Stuart all I can say is, \"You are a very courageous man for reading it out at the funeral, you did really well to get through it the way that you did, as hard as it would have been for you.\"<br><hr><br><b>C</b><br>As a parent of boys who knew Dave, i know the hurt friends have felt with this loss.  From what i have read here and from the efforts i have seen many friends and loved ones put into showing how they felt about Dave to share with others, I can only say that I am sure Dave is looking down on you all smiling knowing the love you all feel for him.  My thoughts are with you all. xox<br><hr><br><b>Daniel \"Fish\" Jones</b><br>I never met Dave. I am a friend of a friend. but i know what its like to lose life at such a young age. when i was 10 my best friend died in a car crash on razorback. he was 11. from the massive response from his friend it appears that Dave has never relied upon the kindness of strangers, but i hope he can make an exception now. i can only hope that i live the life dave did; full of fun, excitement, humour, and good friends. may his friends celebrate life with new found strength and may you all persevere in these tough times.
go with god, kind stranger.

David had a great core of friends ones whom I had met and some I had not. Your support to me, Betty, the rest of the family and Shannon over the past week or so has given us much strength. Daby had an unusual outlook (very carefree) on life but I am sure he lived his life to the Max. He was a great son whom we all will miss. To the Dilly Boys Thanks for you help and support. Thanks for the magnificent cross now at David\'s grave site. Just show us how much he meant to you all and I know the cross is fro your hearts. May be Narz may be kind enough to put a picture on the site to show everyone what I mean. Thanks again to you all, we know your thoughts are still with us.

Narz thank you for a beautiful tribute to my son.
<br><hr><br><b>Emma*</b><br>hey i know ive already ritten in here but i cant help but rite again...my reagards go to his family,friends and girlfriend...use were all so lucky to have a part in his life i just wish i new him like u guys did. All u guys have put so much effort into this website the singlets with his pictures riding into the funeral everything its just so amazing!!!! just reading all these comments makes me cry i know how hard it is to lose a loved one and u dont relise it till there gone on how much they actually mean to u...make sure use tell your loved ones that u love them try to do it everyday coz no one knows wats around the corner hang in there guys my hearts with use all and dave your a gr8 person and i relise y everyone loves u so god dam much...hang in there and dont forget us all coz u will never be forgotten love Em x0x0<br><hr><br><b>No Regrets</b><br>dave was an awesome guy and he lived the fullest life so its only fair that everyone who knew him, takes a leaf out of his book.... laugh at something everyday (even yourself) and make the most outts life.... Dave will never die in my heart and i hope he lives on in everyone\'s...
RIP Dave....life will never be the same...<br><hr><br><b>No Regrets</b><br>dave was an awesome guy who lived life to the max so i think everyone who knew him should remeber him by living life like him....laugh everyday (even at yourself), do nudie runs (no matter how white and hairy ur ass is), and keep your friends close and cherish everday.....dave will always live on in my heart as i m sure he will for alot of people....this is a tradgedy that never should have happened, but maybe this brought everyone closer together (Love everyone and tell them everyday)...

huggs and kisses to everyone who has been truly affected by this and i hope that u cracked a bit of a smile wen dave made it pour on us at his funeral.....REMEMBER THE GOOD TIMES....

<br><hr><br><b>Northey</b><br>Absolute legend of a bloke.I dunno who\'s gonna try n hump me when i walk into mollys now dude..one of the funniest/best guys i\'ve met.
my thoughts are with u and all your mates.<br><hr><br><b>Robyn</b><br>Unfortunately I did not know David either, I wish I did, it would have been an honour and a laugh i\'m told. From listening to the great things people have said it\'s clear that he was an amazing person to have touched so many lives in such a short time. This is for his friends, I hope you agree:
Do not stand on my grave and weep,
for I am not there I do not sleep,
I am the thousand winds that blow
a diamonds glint upon the snow,
I am the soft sun of ripened grain,
the soft gentle autumn rain.
And when you wake in the morning hush,
I am the soft uplifting rush
the quiet birds that curve in flight
the timeless stars that shine at night
so do not stand at my grave and cry,
I am not there
I did not die.
He\'s always with you as you\'ve said, and my thoughts and prayers are for all he loved.<br><hr><br><b>No Name</b><br>why....
live life to the fullest 
dont let 1 feeling go un-noticed or slip by
dont let 1 moment slip you by even it good or bad
dont hezzitate to do any thing just do it
as i like to say \"do it\"
r.i.p dave i dont know wat we r going to do with out u the world is just not the same with out u i wish u never left us but u were needed 4 something else and i wish that u werent but u had to go and will never be forgotten in my heart or ne 1s heart ONLY THE GOOD DIE YOUNG<br><hr><br><b>No Name</b><br>LIFE IS TO LIVE <br><hr><br><b>billy</b><br>hey it sounds like david was a bit of a maddog but i spose if we think hes gone to a better place it will make it a bit easeir for all you morners. Daves family even though i dont know them will be in my prayers for ever and just remember
god loves you and everybody else eternity <br><hr>
<br>
<b>Only a whisper away</b><br>He Is Just Away
You cannot say, you must not say
That he is dead. He is just away!
With a cheery smile and a wave of the hand
He has wandered into an unknown land
And left us dreaming how very fair
it needs must be, since he lingers there;
So think of him faring on, as dear
In the love of There as the love of Here,
Think of him still as the same, and say
He is not dead, he is just away.
<br><hr><br><b>Deirdre Fitzsimmons</b><br>Just a short message to let all of you know that there will be a group counselling session for all who would like to attend as i see from this website that my brother Dave touched a lot of people.  The counselling session is on Friday 19th November at 2pm at Wollondilly Community Health Centre, Harper Close Tahmoor.  Behind the big hall (opposite BILO shopping centre).  All welcome to attend.<br><hr><br>

I didnt know Dave personally but i did ride with him and his crew whenever they came to campbelltown. And hearing about this loss sent a chill down my spine.  Dave always had a smile on his face whenever i saw him and he was always full of nergy and keen to ride.  He always somehow seemes to be the life in the session. Not only a rider like that but a person like that is hard to come by and is a tragic loss like that just doesnt seem fair.  R.I.P Dave im sure you will never be fogotten by your crew and by everyone who knew you.  Ride On<br><hr><br><b>Ronny</b><br>Dave man its been like a week and i still dont believe it properly yet. y u? ur the best guy in the dilly even with where ur spirit is now u still are th best guy in the dilly. dilly for life, do it daves way no regrets. fuk im missin u bro, just come back for a week or so so all of us can say cya later 2 ya, no1 yet has taken ur cheesy grin away. we all miss u. all my respects are with everyone who knew dave, especially his family nd shannon, r.I.p.

My thoughts go out to your family and to Shannon - all of who have been so strong in the past couple of weeks. I love you Dave and I will never forget you. The boys are right - the best part of the Dilly  has been taken from us.. but no goodbyes - just see you soon. RIP Dave, Look after everyone like you always have and we\'ll continue to look up to you. You were a big brother to so many people and such a great friend to everyone. You will never be forgotten.

<br><hr><br>
<b>No Name</b> <br>its something unpredictable but in the end is right i hope u had the time of your life
xxoooxxx<br><hr><br><b>No Name</b><br>I didn\'t know Dave that well.  I think I met him once or twice at a party but I do kno heaps of people that did know Dave. I only just discovered this website after reading the Wollondilly Advertiser.  I decided to have a look and I only got to page 23 of 64 and found myself in a heap on the floor, coz of all the things everyone has said about you Dave.  Your smile must have been amazing, your body must have been the brightest light, your peddles led the way for all the weride crew. I was there the night you had your accident, I was on Razorback and I was asked to turn around, when I asked if the person was ok, the policeman told me that it wasn\'t looking good. From the moment that I turned my car around till the time I reached my destination I was praying that it wasn\'t someone we knew, not another young person to die on our roads. I was horribly wrong. The next morning when I was told it was you, a picture of you popped up in my head, that picture has never left. I din\'t attend your funeral Dave, I felt I didn\'t know you well enough to be there with you, I heard about that day though and all that happened, I heard about the weride crew leading the way for you, I heard about the nuddy run everyone did in remembrance of you walking around half the time with no clothes on and I heard about all the tears that were shed and after reading this site and hearing all those things, it has shown me that you were one in a million Dave, you were significant to all. All that you knew, you made feel special in your own way. To everyone out there that was close to Dave, don\'t dwell on the past, look toward the future, Dave wouldn\'t want you to be sad, remember the good times and don\'t be affraid of crying once in a while, but most of all, I kno you will never forget Dave so don\'t be scared to move on. To Dave\'s family, I know how it feels to lose someone close in your family, it hurts like hell, trust me, it will get easier, my thoughts are with you all.  Rest In Peace Dave.  WE WILL NEVER FORGET YOU xoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxo<br><hr><br>

<b>Betty (Dave's mum)</b><br>I would like to thank everyone who has tried to help us in whatever way to ease the pain our family is feeling since the terrible tragedy. Word\'s can\'t express the way we feel, but I can get some comfort in knowing that David has had such a profound effect on so many and that he has left so many wonderful memories in his short life. To all those friends who used to come and visit us, please keep in touch - we would love to see you! David did have a special gift - the gift of making people smile and I think that\'s the memory most of us will cherish forever. Thanks again from our family for all your support and if you are going to the counselling day this Friday, we\'ll see you there.<br><hr><br>

<b>No Name </b><br>dave we love you rip god bless everyone and keep strong xoxox<br><hr><br><b>Nicole Sharp</b><br>There are so many good things about living in Wollondilly, but one of the hardest is that whenever a tradegy such as this happens, which is all too often, everyone is affected because they either know the person, their family or know someone who knows them. Although I didn\'t really know Dave personally, I can see from this site that so many people knew and loved him and my thoughts are with you all. I was also good friends with Dave\'s sister Deirdre during school. It is terrible, but it takes something like this to make us all realise the importance of being there for your friends, telling them how much you care about them, and of not letting the rest of your life get in the way of friendships. So to Deirdre and all of my other friends who I have slowly lost contact with over the years, I do care about you and will always be there for you if you need me xxx<br><hr><br><b>meg.k</b><br>dave u were a champion at everything a borther to all and the funniest guy eva we luv ya lots alwayz and 4eva xoxoxoxoxo R.I.P <br><hr><br><b>xoxKxox</b><br>Dave i\'m missing you so so much ryt now, it hurts...

Is almost more than I can take, Baby when you touch me
I can feel how much you love me, And it just blows me away
I\'ve never been this close to anyone or anything
I can hear your thoughts, I can see your dreams

I don\'t know how you what you do, I\'m so in love with you
It just keeps getting better, I wanna spend the rest of my life with you by my side, Forever and ever
Every little thing that you do, Baby I\'m amazed by you

The smell of your skin, The taste of your kiss
The way you whisper in the dark
Your hair all around me, baby you surround me
You touch every place in my heart
Oh it feels like the first time every time
I wanna spend the whole night in your eyes

I don\'t know how you do what you do
I\'m so in love with you, it just keeps getting better
I wanna spend the rest of my life with you by my side
Forever and ever
Every little thing that you do, Baby I\'m amazed by you

Every little thing that you do, I\'m so in love with you
It just keeps getting better
I wanna spend the rest of my life with you by my side
Forever and ever
Every little thing that you do
Oh every little thing that you do, Baby I\'m amazed by you

Love from Stephen, this song is so much \'Just Us!\', thankyou for loving me just the way I am.  You have touched my heart in a way no-one else ever will.

<b>No Name</b> <br>We were close when i was in yr 7 but then we grew apart as time dragged on, but i always knew in my heart tha i wud see you again,but now iz going to be a long time... When ever you drove past you\'d beep your horn like crazy, pull over and take me to wherever i was headed even if it was in a diff direction... You knew how to put a smile on everyones face...

I cant wait til i see you again, with your huge cheeky smile, or even your dimply butt. =) we\'ll always love you... Take it easy wherever you are... i know you\'ll be shining down on us, watching our every move and helping us out where itz needed... It will be horrible living without you, you can NEVER be replaced, n will ALWAYS be in our hearts and minds... Not a day goes by, when i dont think about you, or even that day you chased me around a party when you were butt naked... I\'ll never forget your sailor hat... my heart is with you always... 

i loved you, and i dont think that part of me will ever die, and i hope it doesnt.. you made life worth living, now i will live my life for you baby... Everything i do, i\'ll do it for you...<br><hr><br>

He\'d be the first tot ry something new...     I know i speak for everybody when i say this, whenever Dave walked into a full room of people he\'d be the one everyone would see a mile away... Wherever i went i would hope to run into him, but before i ran into him i could see him smile and laugh on he other side...

I saw this quote and thought it very appropriate. \"Wherever a beautiful soul has been there is a trail of beautiful memories\". How close to the truth is that! By the way, I have read alot of messages which tell of funny antics David got up to. Any more would be great - they bring a big smile to my face. Thanks again to all you guys. Reading how much David was loved helps in some small way although I will NEVER understand why he needed to be taken from us so early!<br><hr><br><b>rig a tig tig,</b><br>i posted this in the news section inside of weride but i dunno how many people are reading it, weve got the ok from the council to rename the dirt park at tahmoor in daves name and im calling for a few suggestions cause well we gotta get this just right, nething will be considered weve had the dave andrews dirt park or dna dirt park suggested so far, hell something like hearted like the big ol diggity dave dirt park will be considered, just slap something in an email and send it along to rinkley@hotmail.com, <br><hr><br>

*For Dave.
His life was cut short we\'ll never know why,
For this day is gone in a blink of an eye,
the ones left behind wish they could die,
if only they knew \"why\" should they cry,
the years will go on and people will forget, 
for those close to him will always regret,
that the pain that they felt, 
was the card that was delt,
That they will never be able to say what they felt
So all\'s they can say is to say their goodbye and hope you will fly high, way up in the sky...
RIP dave xoxoxoxox<br><hr><br><b>Elle</b><br>only met u dave a couple of times n if i ever saw u down the street we would most probly walk straight past eachother, but ur death shocked n upset me so much... i cant say anything more or different to what everyobodey else has already said a million times..

<b>Shannon</b><br>
To My Gorgeous Dave
Words cannot describe the feeling in my heart
When I look into the future and know we must be apart,
You always made me smile, we became the best of friends,
I thought we\'d be together until the very end.
I know you\'re watching now and dont want me to cry
But the tears just won\'t stop not matter how hard i try.
I wish I could go back and make sure that you knew
That my life was complete, and it was all because of you.
But now life isn\'t fair, especially not today
Because I found my one true love and now you have to go away.
What happens tomorrow?When i\'m missing you so much,
When I want to hear your voice and I long to feel your touch.
I miss your gorgeous eyes and your everlasting smile,
How low you wore yours pants in that crazy David style.
You tought me everything that I\'ll ever need to know,
How to hug and how to laugh and how to make a strong love grow.
I used to have it all the future looked so clear,
I had my Dave beside me and I had nothing to fear.
But now I know you\'re gone and I know it\'s up to me
To keep you in my heart and set your spirit free.
I promise I won\'t forget but please promise you\'ll stay close
Because to live my life without you is what I fear the most.
I love you so uch Dave and although we\'ve been torn apart
Our love will never die, you\'ll be forever in my heart,
Every step I take every move I make 
I\'ll Be missing you............
Always yours Shannon

Dave, we\'ve had the pleasure of watching you grow from a beautiful looking & beautifully natured little boy to a beautiful looking & beautifully natured young man.As you & our Son, Daniel grew together, so to did  your special friendship & bond grow deeper and stronger.It breaks my heart to know that I cant ease Daniel\'s pain that hes suffering,with just a hug,like I used to when he was a little boy.I feel helpless as I watch Daniel hurting as he  tries to understand and cope with his world being torn apart, as he struggles to get his head around the fact that his remarkable friend that he loves.the one person he could truly relate to,the one person that understood him better than anyone else and the one person who has always been there for him is no longer going to be there.Most people spend there entire lives searching for and never finding that special bond and deep friendship to share.The kind of friend thats there for you through all the good times and the bad.The kind of friend that supports you no matter what,the kind of friend that goes out of his way for you.Gives there all for you asking nothing in return.Daniel was one of the lucky ones Dave, because he had that special irreplaceable bond & friendship with you.Daniel loved you Dave & I know his life will never be the same without you in it.In fact I dont think anyones life will ever be the same, as your special qualities touched us all in one way or another and that cheeky grin of yours was a magical gift,your gift to us all.As each & everyone has said you brought laughter and happiness to all of us and everyone will never be able to fill that empty void that has been left in your place.
Daniels Dad & I thought of you as our second Son, our daughter Shannon thought of you as her second brother and to Daniel you were like a mentor.We will cherish the memories you have left for us, count our blessings that you shared part of your life with us and thank God for the time you were given to us all.One of the saddest days was the day of your funeral, as we walked to the cemetary I was overcome with an overwhelming  sensation, our hearts were full of sadness and pain and yet I felt a weird sense of gladness  as the realisation hit me of just how much you are loved & what it meant to so many people to lose you.I was shown that not only were you special to a lucky few you were special to the hundreds of people who had all come  together to show the depth of their love, to say their farewells and to support your family & your closest friends through this difficult tragic time.I also felt priveleged to belong to that gathering of hundreds, priveleged to know you Dave. You, are truly one in a million and at night as we look to the heavens we will know you are watching over us because youll be that biggest and the  most beautiful twinkling star thats shining the brightest of them all.... just as you shone in your life.
           
          To Betty and Ross--- You must take all the credit for raising such a caring, good natured, loving Son. You must also be one in a million as David, in fact all of your children could only be what you guys laid the foundations for them to be. You must be very proud of them all!!!
 REST IN PEACE  DAVID NEIL ANDREWS xxxxxxxxxxx

Hi Guys, i spoke to Cam today, he told me about this site. So i just thought i\'d post a poem i wrote directly after the incident.

I just don\'t want to say goodbye, a David Andrews tribute:

I am being strong on the outside, but I\'m shattered on the inside, I just can\'t believe you\'re gone; it\'s so unfair to lose a mate so soon.

My heart is aching, my mind is all over the place, I just don\'t want to say goodbye, and it\'s just too soon!

They say that you never forget your time growing up, the laughs, the tears, but you never want to go through the pain of having to say goodbye to a mate way before his time under such tragic circumstances.

I am writing this tribute to express how I feel, but I just don\'t want to say goodbye, it\'s way too soon.

We had so many great memories growing up together, I\'ll never forget them and I\'ll miss you forever. The tears are still flowing, and the pain will not subside, the fun memories, I hold close to my heart of us growing up throughout our years in high school, I\'ll never forget and thinking about them now just tear me apart, make me cry, but I just can\'t handle the fact that I have to say goodbye.

I keep thinking you\'ll be back, you\'ve just gone on a holiday, but I know deep down you\'re up in heaven making it a better place with your charisma and laughter, that we all had the pleasure of experiencing.

The tears are dripping as I piece together this tribute for you my friend, you were such a unique character in every facet.

I\'ll miss you mate, and I\'ll never forget you and how you touched my life.

Love, Powelly.

Love you forever babii boi xx xx xx<br><hr><br><b>Mel Kruf</b><br>I didn\'t know Dave that well but what i did know of him was that he was a great guy and a practica1 joker. i remember this one time at Sam Arguttes 18th when dave offered me a smoke out of the blue and i thought okay., as soon as i lit it up he just started breaking out in laughter as he had shoved it up his nose. It was gross back then but a very cherished memory now.
I never really met Dave until his 18th but i always saw him up at hectors riding around on his pushie with no shirt on. 
My thoughts and respect go to Daves family for producing such a good guy, and shaping him in to the man that he became.
Dave will always live on in everybodys hearts and thoughts.
Love Mel kruf 
R.I.P David Neil Andrews.<br><hr><br><b>S.M</b><br>i still love you.....

Iv known dave since our family moved to bargo, even though we fell out of contact over the years i still regarded him as a great mate. I still remember the hugs i would receive everytime i saw dave, and will miss them forever.
Dave was always full of energy and never looked down on any one or treated them badly (he was a fantastic guy).
Dave will be sadly missed by everyone, and will never be forgoten.
I still remember the time, dave came to Cresent Head with my brother Mitch and our family, my little cousins looked up to dave, wanting to be him when they grew up, as i know many people did.
U always made me smile, and when ever i did something out of character you would say to me \"Im tellin your brother\" and would laugh, with the great laugh and huge smile that you have. 
You were like a brother to me dave, and will always be in my heart.
My thoughts go out to Betty, Ian and family. Dave was a fantastic guy and will be sadly missed by everyone.
I will never forget you dave.
Love ya man xxxxxxxxxxxxxxooooooooooooooooxxxxxxx

Close my eyes to see it when the world gets dark
Got a memory of you I carry in my soul
I wrap it close around me when the nights get cold
If you asked me how I\'m doin\' I\'d say just fine
But the truth is baby, if you could read my mind
Not a day goes by that I don\'t think of you
After all this time you\'re still with me it\'s true
Somehow you remain locked so deep inside, not a day goes by.
<br><hr><br><b>No Name</b><br>One More Day 


Last night I had a crazy dream 

A wish was granted just for me 

It could be for anything 

I didn\'t ask for money 

Or a mansion in Malibu 

I simply wished, for one more day with you 


One more day 

One more time 

One more sunset, maybe I\'d be satisfied 

But then again 

I know what it would do 

Leave me wishing still, for one more day with you 


First thing I\'d do, is pray for time to crawl 

Then I\'d unplug the telephone 

And keep the TV off 

I\'d hold you every second 

Say a million I love you\'s 

That\'s what I\'d do, with one more day with you 


Leave me wishing still, for one more day 

Leave me wishing still, for one more day 
<br><hr><br><b>Senior Constable Darren Moon</b><br>As a police officer I have had the unfortunate task of attending many tragic accidents. On the night in question, I was the officer that attended the scene of Dave\'s accident. I immediately and strangely felt this strong sensation that Dave was a unique person.  I had this strange feeling that I had known Dave for years.  I sit here and read all of the messages that you wonderful people have typed.  To have touched the hearts of so many people in such a short time is nothing short of a miracle. I wish that I could have met Dave and experience his great approach to life.  I would like to express that life is just so short.  After that night I went home and hugged my children and would not let them go. I immediately took leave and spent every minute of my leave with my wife and my two children. Let Dave\'s passing be a lesson to us all that friends and family are just so important. Hug your friends, tell your family that you love them, you never know when the last time you do this might come. For Dave\'s friends, when you have children, treat them like angels as they truly are that. Lets all take a leaf from Dave\'s book and be happy and treat life as a gift.  Ross, mate I am so sorry that we met under these circumstances.  You are truly a strong man and I commend you for that.  Your family is such a wonderful family and that is a credit to you and Betty.  Betty, words cannot express how sorry I am to deliver the tragic news of Dave\'s passing.  I will remember that morning and your sorrow till the day I pass.  You have a great family and you are a great mum. Russell, Deirdre and Ian, guys you have a great brother whom was very proud of you.  I have spoken to you all and have felt the sorrow that you are suffering.  Man didn\'t your brother make an impact in this life. Shannon, keep your chin up and live a life that Dave would have wanted you to live. Remember all the good times that you guys had, I know that you guys will be together again one day.  To all of Dave\'s mates, you are very unique people.  You have all spoken so highly of Dave.  I wish that I had friends such as you guys.  I would love to meet you guys and talk about Dave and look at some of the pictures you guys speak about.  You all seem such great people.  Please come into Picton station some time and have a chat. To Dave, what can I say mate, although our paths crossed for a very short time, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for making me realise that my family and friends are what are so important to me.  As I said earlier, I have attended many accidents, but mate you touched my heart.  Rest in peace mate.  You were truly a gift from god.<br><hr><br><b></b><b>No Name</b><br>

I think that the thoughts of Senior Constable Moon are echoed throughout many households near and far. How one young man has touched the hearts of so many is truly amazing and, Dave, I was lucky enough to be one who has known you since you were just a toddler. Your passing has made me realize just how very important friendships are and they are not to be taken for granted.
Life is so fickle and we never know what lies around the corner so we need to take action now to ensure that we have no regrets if we are taken away as suddenly as you were Dave. Tell those you love that you love them, give them that extra hug. Follow Dave\'s example a give to others the friendships that are true...we saw many of your friends when they all gathered so say farewell..Dave - you are a young man that will always live in the hearts of your friends as they are better people by having had the honour of being able to call you their friend and mate. Even though you have made us very sad we will keep smiling because that is a tribute to your happy face. How we feel :( :(  and how we remember you :) :):):):):):):):):):):):)

to all the boys, you guys have been amazing,dave would be so proud.<br><hr><br><b>Betty (Dave\'s mum)</b><br>Yes Squiz, it still hurts like crazy and we do all have the hugest hole in our hearts that we all have had to face in our lives so far. Every day is a struggle but aren\'t we fortunate that we are able to talk to one another here and let each other know how we feel. People I have spoken to who have lost their children tell me we will feel better in time - we will just learn to cope. So I guess that will be all of us. Please all keep in touch and I agree please put your names on the messages. My love to everyone.<br><hr><br><b>Cainn   aka  Yoss.</b><br>Firstly i would like to thank Betty and Ross for having such a great kid and for sharing him with us. David was 1 of a kind and everyone who ever met him new this, there was something about him that made him stand out and made us love him. Whether it was his killer smile, his laugh, or his ability to make every minute u spent with him memorable. U will never meet another person who didnt have one person hate them. That just shows how much dave was loved. Dave was with us at the start and he will be with us at the end. Dave, u were a friend , a mate, a brother, a gift! To everyone one who every spent time with u, whether it be 1 minute or 20yrs. Thank u David Neil Andrews, u will never be forgotten. Love u mate. Peace.<br><hr><br><b>Lynne Connor</b><br>I feel great sadness each afternoon I pass by Bargo skate park, knowing I will never again see Dave\'s smiling face & friendly wave. He was a unique person who gave us all a special part of himself.
Betty, my thoughts are with you everyday. I can only amagine how hard your life must feel, please find strength in the knowledge that Dave was loved by so many people & he will be with you always. I found this quote & thought of Dave

\" In life we find an angel
  that walks upon this earth
  No wings or halo showing
  but Heavens gift at birth \"

  May we feel Dave\'s love beside us
  to help us find the way
  He is here within our presence
  & will never fade away.<br><hr><br><b>CD OF DAVID - NOW AVAILABLE</b><br>CD of Davids Photo (Powerpoint) Presentation from the wake are available if you would like a copy. Contact Deirdre on 0412 711 090 or Ian on 1431 106 831.<br><hr><br><b>michelle</b><br>Betty, all the love that Dave carried with him and shared to all in every aspect of his life is a reflection of the love that he was raised and nertured with his whole life. Thank you for being who you are and continuing to care for everyone who hurts. You are truely a beautiful woman.
I visit Dave often, it is some how unrealistic, to those that i have seen at Daves ta for the hugs. Dave will never not be missed he had too much magic...<br><hr><br><b>Bargo Meg</b><br>I miss you Dave. I jst want you to come back. Not only for me but for all the boys and for Shannon and for your family. We all miss you like crazy and jst want to see you again. I wish I could say that it would be different if I had a chance to say goodbye, but that would be lying..coz i dont jst wanna see you once more, i jst want you to come back. one more time isn\'t enough..jst come back and never leave. I hate that someone so great has been taken from us and it\'s just so unfair that someone so loved - by everyone - had to leave. I love you Dave and I will never stop missing you.<br><hr>

YOU NEVER NO WAT YOU\'VE GOT TILL ITS GONE!!! my prayers go out to every single person who ever meet dave, i can not even begin to think of wat goes through the heads of his family and girl friend. dave always smiled and keept happy, he lived his life the way we should all live ours. he (DAVE) was an inspiration to us all.                 R.I.P....D.N.A              much love!                             <br><hr><br><b>Sharelle</b><br>Even though over the past two years i had only known dave through my boyfriend,Lloyd...his beautiful nature has had a huge impact on the way i now look at life. It is short and should be treated as though every day is your last.To daves parents, id like to thank you for the beautiful son u have raised and brought into our lives. It is true that,i too have never met a single person who has EVER had a bad word to say about dave. Also, i had Never once come across dave when he didn\'t have an unbelievable beautiful smile on his face! To the parents of dave,u are truely blessed to have had an angel with you every day for 20 years. To all Daves mates and Family,Grant and deano, bennos and matty lye, benny S,jacko, jad, scotty and jason, jess, ronny, shauny,etc. and to the many,if not hundreds more, no words that have ever entered my mind can express howbadly i feel for you all. feeling helpless towards my baby through all of his grief, i cannot even begin to imagine what you are all so bravely struggling through.To Constable darren moon,your words were touching for lack of a better term. Dave deserves the best and hopefully the best is where he is now,with my sister and many of our friends and family in heaven. Love ya Dave, you were and still are, an angel and one in a billion. we love u mate.                ***R.I.P***<br><hr><br><b>Powelly / \'Git\'</b><br>Since i found out about this website some weeks ago, i visited daily, as it feels good to read how people explain how Dave touched our lives.

I, like everyone else is finding this bloody hard to overcome, i don\'t think i ever will, but what makes me smile is all the good times we shared, and knowing that Dave was on top of the world at his untimely passing. 

I recently visited Dave\'s grave site, it was something i knew i had to do, but, in a way i was scared. Once i got there i just cried and spoke to Dave as if he was standing there in front of me, i was exlianing how i felt and that i missed him so much. I am so grateful that i have done this, and from now on i\'ll be visiting there as much as possible. 

Dave, you were with us for such a short time, but what you did in that time will stay with us forever, i miss you mate.

Love Powelly.   <br><hr><br><b>S.M</b><br>i cant say i know one person that goes a day without thinking about you Davey...

david my brother this ones for you<br><hr><br><b>Jenny</b><br>Dave was truly a great guy and his memory will never be forgotten, but to all of Dave\'s friends out there, I just want to say how proud I am and how lucky I feel to know some of YOU. The love and support you have given each other over the last 7 weeks has been truly amazing. To see you all come together, in a way that some grown men and women could never do, is something truly beautiful and you should all be very proud and honoured to be the people that you are. 

So keep living your lives like there may be no tomorrow and use each others strengths to pull you through. Cheers guys. <br><hr><br><b></b><b>No Name</b><br>
Merry Christmas Dave***<br><hr><br><b>Davids Dad</b><br>Hi Guys, by the time I put this on the weride site Betty will be on her way home from a holiday on the Gold Coast, to the beautiful Memorial Garden and other projects you did over the weekend. The blitz was well concealed from Betty and well organised by those responsible. Please accept from me the families sincere thanks for your wonderful gesture of the memorial Garden, Pergola (Entertainment area), Pathways and Driveway. For you to feel so strongly about David to do this for us is absolutely wonderful. Please all step back and take a bow. You have all called David a friend and we can see that not only was he your friend but you were his friend. Thanks also must go to all the local businesses who have donated material for Davids friends to do this project. There were about 50 of Davids friends there on Saturday and about 30 on Sunday who worked extremely hard to ensure it was completed on time. Once again please accept the families sincere thanks. You also are truly special people and we are proud to know you.<br><hr><br><b>Betty (Dave\'s mum)</b><br>Yes, Im now home from a relaxing week away in Surfers, and what can I say. Words cant explain how I felt when I came home and found my backyard transformed into the most beautiful memorial garden and to see all you guys there took my breath away. You are all so wonderful and what you have done for not only me but all our family over the past 8 weeks just shows the love you have for David and the great bond you have with each other. To have worked so hard to make the garden and driveway for us leaves me speechless. When you come around home now we will have a special place to sit and have a chat (I know David will be sitting there with us)- you know you are all welcome.
For most (if not all) of us every day is a struggle - there are tears and an overwhelming sadness but we are so thankful at being able to \'talk\' to one another here and I for one am ever grateful to those who have made it possible.
If we stick together and help one another out when the going gets tough I\'m sure we will learn to cope. Remembering all the good times and the joy that David bought to everyone helps us smile again! I am just so amazed as to the positive
effect David had on so many people. 
For now, THE BIGGEST THANK YOU to you all not only for the work you have just done for us but for all the other things - no matter how small. 
Try to have the best Christmas you can - enjoy the time you have with your family and friends, keep safe and we hope to see you sometime over the festive season. OUR LOVE TO YOU ALL!<br><hr><br><b>Luke Walker</b><br>Merry Christmas Dave............I miss you fella!<br><hr><br><b>Davids Dad</b><br>Just a reminder that the family would like to invite you to Davids place (at the cemetary) on Christmas moring at 9.30am.

Ive heard that those who went to Melbourne had a great time and glad you all made it back OK. Thanks to those who come around from time to time to have a chat - you know youre always welcome and thanks for being there for Ian, too. This time of the year is particularly hard for us and probably all you guys too - trying to join in the spirit knowing there is a great hole in our lives. We can only take each day at a time - some are OK and some arent and that\'s the way it will be. My dad had a saying that \"you have to learn to roll with the punches\". Trying to cope with this almost \"knock out punch\" is going to be a long, long process and we will have some good days and some bad days, but we have to realise that this is normal in the grieving process. Being there for one another is the best way to get through and move slowly forward. Thanks to those who sit and chat with Dave.Im sure he can sense all the visitors he has and the thoughtful ways you have decorated \"his place\". My best wishes go to everyone and to those still on holidays have a safe and happy time, to those of us back at work -at least we have something to keep us occupied I suppose. Bye for now. <br><hr><br><b>Debra (Dave\'s mum\'s friend from the U.S.A.)</b><br>David, your smile made it all the way to New York in the U.S.A.!   Your mum and I have been friends since we were both 13 years old and she has kept me informed of the highlights of your life, and your siblings lives, since each of you were born.  Betty and Ross, my heart aches for you.  Please know that you and your family are in my thoughts and prayers.    With love, Debbie<br><hr><br><b>tara</b><br>i didnt know dave i just knew people who were blessed to have known him. i have sat here for the past 2 and a half hours reading about how great a guy dave was and ive realised that i missed out. it sounds like words cant describe how much everyone loved him and how much everyone misses him. hes lucky to have such great friends and family...R.I.P xxx<br><hr><br><b>=CrAcKer= and crew</b><br>R.I.P xoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxox p.s i\'ll miss u lov kirsty, mel, and brett<br><hr><br><b>RIP BRO</b><br>Dave you are the man and will always be the man. If you were only being stupid that tradgic night we all know u wouldve walked out laughing with a bit of cursing. You were the man that felt no pain nd couldnt be hurt for to long, we all sen u stack many times which looked far worse, bro im sittin here crying thinking of how upsetting it was seing you for the ;ast time till i see u next.bro ur funeral was huge i know of no1 else that had the rep of u. Everyone luvd ya nd still does love you. see you in a while bro, love ya xXx<br><hr><br>
<b>Betty (Dave\'s mum)</b><br>
Yes, David was always up for a challenge and always seemed to come up smiling despite any pain when things didn\'t quite go to plan, but on that terrible night which changed so many lives forever,it appears he was simply driving home from work when tragedy struck. <br><hr><br><b></b><b>No Name</b><br>
How do you do it Mrs Andrews - how do you stay so brave for so many? <br><hr><br><b>Betty (Dave\'s mum)</b><br>I\'m not sure if it\'s bravery. If we could turn back the clock we would change things, but we can\'t so we have to deal with this the best way we can. Being able to write on this website is a godsend to many, including me, and having so many of David\'s friends visit helps in some way. This is the hardest thing we have all had to deal with probably and we have a choice really to \'sink\' or \'swim\', and I don\'t think David would want us to \'sink\'. To look to the future knowing David won\'t be a part of it breaks my heart and there will be tears and sadness probably forever, but we do have the great memories and lots of people around us to love and comfort each other, so we try the best we can to cope. We will all come across times in our lives where we will hit rock bottom but we have to find the strength to \'rise up\' again - and we will! Thanks again for thinking of us - you all have done so much to help us.<br><hr><br><b>Luke Walker</b><br>Dave i just want one more ride........this is fucked..........i love you dude ;)<br><hr><br><b>Bargo Meg</b><br>Davey christmas and new years just didnt feel the same without you.

For a minute, all the world can change.... thiz iz tru i think for a lot of people i know for myself wen i herd the news of yuor accident baby the world just STOPPED, evrything just stopped. in that half hor or so nothing seemed real..... This mite not make sense now but words cant express wat i am trying to say. your beta than everyone else David... i could trust you in everyway, you were there in everyway......RIP... xx xx xx<br><hr><br><b>Worth A Read</b><br>IF I KNEW 
 
 If I knew it would be the last time 
 That I\'d see you fall asleep, 
 I would tuck you in more tightly 
 and pray the Lord, your soul to keep. 
 
 If I knew it would be the last time 
 that I see you walk out the door, 
 I would give you a hug and kiss 
 and call you back for one more. 
 
 If I knew it would be the last time 
 I\'d hear your voice lifted up in praise, 
 I would video tape each action and word, 
 so I could play them back day after day. 
 
 If I knew it would be the last time, 
 I could spare an extra minute 
 to stop and say \"I love you,\" 
 instead of assuming you would KNOW I do. 
 
 If I knew it would be the last time 
 I would be there to share your day, 
 Well I\'m sure you\'ll have so many more, 
 so I can let just this one slip away. 
 
 For surely there\'s always tomorrow 
 to make up for an oversight, 
 and we always get a second chance 
 to make everything just right. 
 
 There will always be another day 
 to say \"I love you,\" 
 And certainly there\'s another chance 
 to say our \"Anything I can do?\" 
 
 But just in case I might be wrong, 
 and today is all I get, 
 I\'d like to say how much I love you 
 and I hope we never forget. 
 
 Tomorrow is not promised to anyone, 
 young or old alike, 
 And today may be the last chance 
 you get to hold your loved one tight. 
 
 So if you\'re waiting for tomorrow, 
 why not do it today? 
 For if tomorrow never comes, 
 you\'ll surely regret the day, 
 
 That you didn\'t take that extra time 
 for a smile, a hug, or a kiss 
 and you were too busy to grant someone, 
 what turned out to be their one last wish. 
 
 So hold your loved ones close today, 
 and whisper in their ear, 
 Tell them how much you love them 
 and that you\'ll always hold them dear 
 
 Take time to say \"I\'m sorry,\" 
 \"Please forgive me,\" \"Thank you,\" or \"It\'s okay.\" 
 And if tomorrow never comes, 
 you\'ll have no regrets about today.

<br><hr><br><b></b><b>BENEFIT NIGHT 5th February 2005</b><br>
The 4th of February should have been Dave\'s 21st birthday we should be having one of the biggest party\'s Bargo has seen. Unfortunately this will not be. So we have organised a Celebration of Dave\'s life to be held on the 5th of February at Picton Bowling Club. It will be a coming together for all those who knew and loved Dave.
It will also be a night where we can come together as the \"Dilly\" community to help raise some money for the Andrews family.  Please refer to above emails as to where to purchase tickets. It will be a great night. There will be auctions and raffles with the prizes being donated from the local businesses. Many of whom don\'t usually donate but because it\'s for Dave gave generously.
So please get your tickets and tell your friends. The cost is $40, this includes a three course meal, drinks can be purchased from the bar and remember there is a courtesy \'bus to take us home. So be there for Dave.
Thank you Jo.<br><hr><br><b>leash </b><br>dave, i though of u on xmas and new years, and definatly had a drink for u too! the other night i read your funeral handout and looked at ur pictures and had a lil cry, miss u lots..hope ur having a blast up there, and i hope ur gettin on the cans too! love u mate. ross & betty & family and shannon.. you are all truly so brave. i hope u all had the best xmas and new years that u could. dave was the best person, ross and betty you should be so proud! and i know u would be!! it was a priveledge knowing your son and you did a very good job. everyone in the dilly loves him so much and will never forget him.<br><hr><br>

i dont know what we\'re all supposed to do here without our Dave to make us smile and push us to our limits- its so weird i was so used to seeing you around all the time, bein a total shit head- being cheeky alwayz tell\'n the boys to stop being soft n jus do it- anything.... I dont like the way things hav ended up, buti am proud of Dave\'s family for being so strong n pulling themselves together at sch a bag time. I caqn honestly say that dave is looking down on us all smiling hiz cheeky smile if hez not doing that hez running around without pants on... i love you baby xxx Take it Eazy mwa mwa.... i miss you running around call\'n me a weido coz i did something out of character eventho you\'d go and sdo exactly what i had just done.... there are so many things i miss, ut i still  have the memories i guess... I cant wait to see your angel eyes n beautiful face agin... xxx Love always<br><hr><br><b>Betty (Dave\'s mum)</b><br>I thought I\'d let you all know that I met with a psychic this week. It seems David has been back to visit. I went to see this lady with an open mind, not knowing what to expect and I was told a few things that really got me thinking. I was told, among other things, that at present David is taking care of the children (something he did here as well). Something had happened at home - an object was moved to a different spot in our kitchen when no-one was in the room. The psychic hadn\'t been told this and she mentioned to me (with a smile on her face at the time when it seemed David was telling her, smiling)that David moved the object as a joke. I like to think she\'s right, and I have no other explanation of how it moved. There are a couple more things which have happened which she hadn\'t been told about and it seemed David had mentioned to her (quite bazaar!), but I do believe that David is watching over us.

Just thought I\'d share this with you.<br><hr><br><b></b>Go Dave- you never caese to amaze me- still being cheeky even tho yoour sooo far away!!You always were ne for FUN n weird things! Dave will always watch over us and i will always believe that! It has been 3 months now since we havent seen his beautiful face but i have to say it feels like it has been a lot longer than 12 weeks.<br>

Doesn\'t his place look bright and cheery - just how he would like it to be. You guys never cease to amaze me with how you show us that David is so much a part of your lives and the respect you showed our family in particular when Ross gave his speech brought me to tears. I\'m positive David would have loved the small quiet get-together we had on Friday and the way we celebrated his 21st on Saturday in a party-like atmosphere.

This lady then said that she had known of someone, and she was then told that this person wanted to thank everyone for the tribute night (I don\'t even think this lady knew the tribute night was held) and also to thank everyone for keeping his \'site good\'. She was also told that \'he was OK\'. Also mentioned the name \'Al\', who I have been told is the name of Jay Dowse(?) dad. Also the psychic mentioned that there will soon be a celebration or reception in a hall (Russell and Amy are getting married soon....)

i\'m just so tired
wont you sing me to sleep
and fly through my dreams
so i can hitch a ride with you tonight
and get away from this place
have a new name and face
we just aint the same without you in our lives
late night drives, all alone in my car
i can\'t help but start
singing lines from all our favorite songs
and melodies in the air 
singin life just aint fair
sometimes i still just can\'t believe you\'re gone
and im sure the view from heaven
beats the hell out of mine here
and if we all believe in heaven,
maybe we\'ll make it through one more year 
down here

feel your fire, 
when its cold in my heart
and things sorta start
remindin\' me of my last night with you
i only need one more day
just one more chance to say
i wish that i had gone up with you too
and i\'m sure the view from heaven 
beats the hell out of mine here
and if we all believe in heaven
maybe we\'ll make it through one more year 
down here

you wont be comin\' back
and i didn\'t get to say goodbye 
i really wish i got to say goodbye
and im sure the view from heaven 
beats the hell out of mine here
and if we all believe in heaven 
maybe we\'ll make it through one more year
i hope that all is well in heaven
cause it\'s all shot to hell down here
i hope that i find you in heaven
cause i\'m so...
lost without you down here
you wont be coming back
and i didn\'t get to say goodbye 
i really wish i got to say goodbye...Xx<br><hr><br><b></b><b>No Name</b><br>

But I (along with my family and probably everyone else who knew him) had no idea the impact my beautiful son had on not only those who knew him but those who have come to know him thru this site. These comments have bought tears to my eyes - proud tears I must say. Those who didn\'t know David before his accident, I realise now, really did miss out on something special and I\'m sure I\'m not alone when I say those of us who knew him really were blessed.

Hi everyone, i just thought i would put my story in. Im best Friends with Tara.W and my heart went out for her when Dave died, She was really upset. But i never new Dave, never saw him, never spoke to him. But recently i have been dreaming of this guy constantly, i had never saw this person before but in every dream he is driving and always has a smile on his face. Till yesterday i didnt know who he was. I found out because as i was looking for something on the internet and this website just popped up and once i saw that the picture on here was him, i broke down. Through my dreams Dave seems like the most beautiful person in the universe, his smile is so unlifting it scary. But i never met him when he was here with all you guys. But im learning stuff about him. Please dont leave my dreams Dave!<br><hr><br><b></b><b>No Name</b><br>

These are times that really bring it home that there is one very important part of our lives missing. Maybe we could all put aside some quiet time on Sunday to reflect on some of the special moments we shared with David. Easter is particularly sad for my family as my sister Janet passed away from cancer 23 years ago on Good Friday. I feel Easter Sunday is one of the most special days of the year and it might be made all the more special if we take a step back, take some deep breaths and have some quiet time. Happy Easter to everyone and for those going away, please be careful and take a break every now and then if you\'re driving long distances.

At least now we all know someone absolutely gorgeouz, sweet, funni, caring and all of the above is watching down on uz making sure every passing second of our lives is the best.. For Amy and Russell, i would just like to say that i am sure that Dave will be standing next to the both of you on your very special day, with a big smile on his face, tho you wont see him he will see you. Dave is alwayz watching us, he hasnt missed out on anything in our lives. I know that nothing i nor anyone else can say will tak away the EMPTINESS we ALL feel inside, but i just thought i should share this.

You’re on the other side, you see things different now.
With us but a scant 20 years – how short it was
The memories, the words you did record
They will always remain, set in our hearts forever
That lovely smile, cheeky laugh and silly wave
You left so many images, for your family, friends and mates
Our lives are richer now, for you having crossed our paths
We’ll all see you some time on the other side.
We’ll all remember, “You’re only a whisper away”.
<br><hr><br><b>Betty (Dave\'s mum)</b><br>I was lucky enough to watch a short video last night of the \'weride\' boys at the jumps - I loved it. To see David and hear his voice made me cry, but I am glad I had it to watch. I know there are other videos out there. I\'d love to see them and maybe we could put them together and make a long video.

So please anyone out there with footage of David either riding, on holidays or just goofing off get in touch with me. Thank you.<br><hr><br><b>Ryann</b><br>Betty, Id be more than happy to put all this footage together of dave..<br><hr><br><b>ROCHE</b><br>Hey buddy, missing you heaps, this place just aint the same without you around to light it up. you\'d be proud of dean man, the little bastard pulled a flip, we both knew he could do it he just had to tell himself that, he had a great teacher and idol to learn from. i know your looking after your boys, thanks. peace out my nigger. love u heaps bro. <br><hr><br><b>One Sweet Day xxx..xxx..xxx</b><br>i know that life may not mean much to some, but i know life meant a lot to Dave, and for him to have been the one whoz life has been cut short seems WRONG, i know i am definatley being selfish by wanting him back here just for one more hug, one more slap on my ass, one more gigle, smile. i just want to hear him speak again, see him running like crazy cos he wants to share the silly stunt he just pulled or a new trick he landed on his bmx, all these things i just want one more, and for that one more to NEVER END!! I hope the Andrews family had the best Easter they could possibly hav had... U guys rock, i dont know you all but i did know Dave n occassionally tlk to Ian, but thank yous o much for bringing David into all of our lives, he has blessed them all...

Well Russell and Amy\'s wedding went almost perfectly. We all know that there was one very important person missing. Dave was remembered during the night and was given a toast. Some time ago I mentioned that Shannon and I went to a local clairvoyant who mentioned to me to watch for a bird near a window-sill. I have been doing that and up until Saturday the only birds that I had noticed near window-sills were either indian minors and I figured David would have more class than to visit us as one of those ugly birds and half-drowned pigeons which looked pretty miserable. When Russell and Amy came around yesterday they were telling us that they had been woken by a \'peck-pecking\' at the window quite early on Sunday morning - they spent their honeymoon night at Peppertree Ridge? Razorback (no not the nudist hippie place). They couldnt make out what the noise was, and when they woke up enough, they saw a kookaburra outside their window pecking away for some time. I mentioned what the clairvoyant had said to me and Russell figured it was in fact David getting him back for waking him up one afternoon by bashing the daylights out of Ian\'s drums. They say that good things come to those that wait and I knew that that bird would appear eventually.<br><hr><br><b></b><b></b><b>No Name</b><br>

<br><hr><br><b>Betty (Dave\'s mum)</b><br>Yes, that\'s what I think when people write little stories here - and I\'ve just remembered what they call kookaburras - KING OF THE BUSH!!! Yes, it was David Im sure.<br><hr><br><b></b><b>No Name</b><br>

I had placed something special there for David which has been thoughtlessly removed and you have no idea how upsetting it is so the other friends whose objects which have been taken are probably just as upset as me.

Firstly I want to thank all of David\'s friends who, by their thoughtfulness and hard work, have now left an everlasting visual memory of David in the \'dilly. Secondly, I want to mention something that the spiritual medium said to me some months ago that will make the skatepark more meaningful for everyone I think - she told me that David didn\'t want to be remembered at Razorback, she said that \'David wanted to be remembered at his favourite place, and his friends knew where that was\'.

When I wrote my message yesterday I wasn\'t sure whether I could let everyone know the baby\'s name, but I can let you know now. His name is Brody David. Deirdre and Sean were always going to have the second name as David but it wasn\'t until a few days ago that they decided that Brody was the first name. AND after these names were decided on they looked up their meanings and would you believe that Brody means brother and David means beloved. How amazing and special is that! It blew me away when I was told.<br><hr><br><b>Ryann</b><br>That is truly something special, congrats on it all deidre and sean..<br><hr><br><b></b><br>congratulationz Deidre n Sean, you hav been blessed with a beautiful baby boy, and i know Dave is watching over you all knowing he has another nephew...

Your beautiful nature haz blessed many lives- i know that when i wake in the morning n go to sleep at night that we are ALL being watched by an angel... You r so special to everyone that knew you- n i know that everyone reacts to your death in different wayz but we all miss you so very much n love you with all our hearts!!! i love you and so does everyone else baby boi... ****MWA****  take it easy up there n keep smiling. =) hehehe... love you long time sweetheart xx xx xx<br><hr><br><b>pete irving...bargo pete</b><br>its been 6 months and 18 days and everyday is just as painful as the one before. when u were here i knew i loved u and i knew u were my best mate in the whole world but i never realised just how much of an impact your death could have on my life or the lives of everyone left behind. ive been told time and time again that things will get easier, that we will be able to deal with whats happened and be able to just remember the good times we all had with u. I just wanna no when thats goin to be, whenever i think of the good times we had together a tear comes to my eye cause i no now that those times can never happen again, i want to be able to no that your happy where you are and i cant. So many unanswered questions and thoughts fill my head. Every day you are the first and last thing on my mind and i couldnt have it any other way. i miss you more than these words can ever describe dave, the dilly has changed so much without you here and so has everyone in it... Hope fully for my sake its not to long till i see u again. peace <br><hr><br><b>Betty (Dave\'s mum)</b><br>Pete, everything you just wrote is everything I feel and Im pretty sure everyone who gets on here probably feels. It is hard to come to terms with knowing that David wont be here to make us smile or to cheer us up when we need it - which was one of his great abilities and one which I for one was envious of. Wouldn\'t we all love to be able to have David\'s great character! How I would love to be able to make things better for you all - to be able to ease your pain. You all know that if you feel like you need a chat or a bit of comfort Im there for you. It helps me too to talk to you guys not only here but fact to face. The love and support we give each other is what will help us, particularly on those days when the pain of our loss seems almost unbearable. I love all you guys.<br><hr><br><b>Ronny</b><br>hey ppl pete man u know ill b here 4 ya im feelin the same way, life is 1 screwed up thing wen u lose some1 that meant alot to you, i always use 2 look up at dave as bein 1 of the coolest ppl ever, i still do but wats even more screwed up is wen that you lose a loved 1 that u and the rest ofthe area cared for.... i hope your goin well up there dave coz we sure are still missing you..sorry if what i wrote is a bit confusin ive had a few rums 4 ya dave nd now im off 2 bed..

the youth centre is working with Daves family in planning the biggest kick ass memorial service the dilly has ever seen.

love ya miss ya Dave<br><hr><br><b>SK</b><br>I just want to stay... David Loved you Lisa... He always have and always will.. And dont let anyone tell you different. Lisa, Hang in there cause i know your finding it hard to with no support from anyone. Because everyone has turned their backs on you... I love you girl with all my heart... And i\'ll always be here for you.. Dave is forever with you in your heart remember that despite what anyone tells you... Missin your ever smiling face Dave...<br><hr><br><b></b><br>To anyone who has been taking the gifts lisa has been leaving for dave at his grave... Leave them alone.. She has a right to mourn too.. And she doesnt need any petty games from anyone!
 <br><hr><br><b>Betty (Dave\'s mum)</b><br>I do agree. Its upsetting to hear things like this - I know what its like to have gifts taken from Davids site. I would hope that gifts placed with David from particular people are NOT deliberately removed. What has happened to us over the last 7 months as I have said before is probably one of the most emotionally draining periods in our lives and we all need to do what is best for everyone to help us get by. Let us remember here that Davids passing has effected more people than we will ever know and we must let everyone handle their grief in their own way. <br><hr><br><b>Davids Dad</b><br>Davids memory is something special to everyone. Those close to him at the time of passing and those who shared his wonderful life some time earlier. We as a family have always wanted everyone to celebrate Davids amazing life. Everyone remembers his smile, his funny antics, his love for everyone he embraced (there are so many of us). David will no matter what may come or go forever be in our hearts (only a whisper away. Dave we all love you and miss your presence.<br><hr><br><b></b><br>oh davey boy this sucks hard...why.is still the question thats comes to my head all the time.and il never no why you had to be taken so early but hey they must of needed you somewhere else to make everyone as happy as you did when you were here.. you were a true gift to no  and il never ever forget you..cant wait to see you bub... all my love ..love you matey  x x x <br><hr>

Dave\'s Girls...</b><br>Lisa and Shannon you are the most luckiest girls, you should both cherish the memories and the love that you shared with dave both in different ways... you were both at one time or another his girls and no one can take that.. you both have become apart of his family.. Dave was an amazing boy and you should both be happy that you were able to become apart of his life and expereince his love. There would be a thousand girls that would have jumped at the chance to steal a kiss or more (he was a hotty)but he chose to share these with you... stop being so nasty and rememeber the love and fun times that i know he brought to you both so often... he wouldnt want you to be nasty to each other and rather you support each other becuase you both knew in a loving and special way and only you can share that with each other... we know it is difficult and hard but think of dave.... he is very much missed and i couldnt imagine what it could be like to loose my boy but we should be trying to support each othernot fight....

I feel the same way at the moment. Over the last couple of days my tears have come back and yes it is crap without David here. Maybe the reality is starting to hit us. The counsellor told us we would have good times and bad times and during the bad times we will need one another for support. Thank god for this site where we can get on and say how we feel and all you wonderful people.<br><hr><br><b>Lauren Roche</b><br>dave i miss you so much i hate knowing that i cant just walk up the road and see you or just pick up the phone and call you all i can do now is drive over the other side and sit and and stare at where you rest. i know i havent been over for a while but thats only because im so scared i hate facing up to the fact that your gone. everyone keeps telling me not to be scared but i cant help it. i think to my self im going to go see dave and have a chat to him but i get there and no words come out. i know what i want to say but it just wont come out. but there are a few words to do come out and that is i love you so much and miss you lots and lots. i had my 18th and i ended up crying myslef to sleep because you werent there teasing me like you used to be honestly whats a birthday with out you dave. i have not gone a day since your accident without thinking about you and all the good times we used to have. there are so many more good times to come for us we will one day meet again. i cant wait to see my big bro again. chris\'s 21st is coming up dave i know if you could you would be here running a muck but i  know you are going to be here in so many peoples hearts. well im just dribbeling now so im going to leave you now. but always remember dave i will always love you and miss you its gets harder and harder every day but i know one day when i see you i will feel no more pain. i love you big bro PEACE OUT mwa<br><hr><br><b></b><br>I wish there was something i could say

Could we ever forget those priceless moments, the answer of course is never; for you were part of our lives for a brief time but youre part of our hearts forever\". Thought this might brighten what is otherwise a cold and bleak day. Bye for now.<br><hr><br><b>Betty (Dave\'s mum)</b><br>Oh! I almost forgot - happy 21st Chris.<br><hr><br><b>Powelly / \'Git\'</b><br>
I am just about to leave for Rochie\'s 21st tonight (July 2) and for a moment, i was like i can\'t wait to get there and see Dave. Sadly though, it hit me and you won\'t be there in person, but in spirit. It hurts all the time to know that you\'re not around anymore, because i miss you so so so much. 

Tonight, i will be thinking of you, and i will not be the only one mate. I hope all is well up in heaven and your humour is lighting it up, as i know it would be. 

One moment that is always in my mind, is at Rochies one night (2000, i think) when we were about to throw \'Margo\' in the pool, and as we were doing it, he yelled out, \"I thought you guys were my friends\" such a classic line and one that i\'ll never forget.

Love ya Dave,

    <b>RIP Mitchell Searle</b><br>
  On behalf of my family and Davids friends I wish to extend our deepest sympathy at to Bill & Roslyn Searle, family and friends at the passing of yet another Dilly boy. Mitchell and David had at least one thing in common that being a great smile. It is understood that Mitchell passed away in his sleep in the early hour of this morning following a long battle with a brain tumor. I know both Dave and Mitchell will have a few great parties when they get together. We love you both - Dave and Mitchell RIP - Davids Dad</p>
<p><b>Only a whisper away<br>
</b>He Is Just Away You cannot say, you must not say That he is dead. He is just away! With a cheery smile and a wave of the hand He has wandered into an unknown land And left us dreaming how very fair it needs must be, since he lingers there; So think of him faring on, as dear In the love of There as the love of Here, Think of him still as the same, and say He is not dead, he is just away. <br>

Narz<br><hr><br><b>Jenz</b><br>Its just so not fair. why does god want to take away the best people we will ever meet. Both had the biggest smiles that we cant erase and both so funny. They sure did leave great memories though. How we are going to miss mitch like we did dave. god above stop breaking our hearts and taking our people. love you dearly boys. take care of eachother. <br><hr><br><b>missing you</b><br>you will never leave my heart, our time together was incredible, unforgettable, inspirable and undeniable.. i havnt been to this web site before but i must tell you it killed me.. not a day passes that i dont think of the precious time we spent together.. i love you with all my heart and soul xxxxxx you found a way inside my heart xxxx<br><hr><br><b>rip mitch</b><br>sadly missed, rest in peace darling<br><hr><br><b>Betty (Dave\'s mum)</b><br>Fate has dealt us yet another bad hand! Jenz is right it just isnt fair - 2 of the most beautiful boys - boys you knew would always leave you smiling - have been taken away. Another piece of our hearts are shattered. To Ros Bill Sarah and Emily my deepest sympathy. I know there are no words to describe the loss of such a loved child. Our boys had such wonderful friends and they become our friends. This is yet another time we will need one another for support and strength and I know that all you \'dilly people will be there for one another. There are so many questions that we will never get answers for and if we dwell on them too much they will eat us away.Who knows why these 2 special people have been taken away from us but let us try to take comfort in knowing that they are both together and in time will probably be causing mayhem (with alot of laughter in there too).

My love to everyone.<br><hr><br><b></b><br>stop taking them away from us!! both genuine boyz, both with their own uniqueness n both been taken away so suddenly, itz not fair, i mean so many people are still hurt from Dave going n now mitchy too, thatz jus not right!!! n i took them both for granted i think a lot of them did!! but all i kno iz that mitch made sure everyone knew how he felt about them,n how much he loved them (jus with a simple hug or kiss- they always counted) as did dave... i will neva forget either of you two, n i hope yous hav fun together.... itz just not right, they\'re both so young, n shudnt hav had their lives cut so short!!! peace out, love you forever n you\'ll alwayz hav our hearts boyz!!! love alwayz, xxx<br><hr><br><b>it hurts so much</b><br><br><hr><br><b></b><br>you know the emptiness has actually gotten bigger now<br><hr><br><b>Mitchells Funeral</b><br>Mitchells Funeral will be held at St. Pauls Catholic Church, CAMDEN on Monday the 8th August at 11.00am.

Along side his family Mitch has a very large number of freinds.
Yes he could bring a smill to any face.
Hay Mitch, do you remember the time when we were at Wee Jasper and we went for a walk up the river and some person gave us a yabie and we took it back to camp and said to everyone we cought it with our hands. I do.
I can also recall all the fun we had on our many fishing & camping trips. I can still see you by that camp fire, with a smile from ear to ear, like a kid on Christmas day.
Yes this young champion,& hero did leave us at a young age and for us we will remember him for the rest of ours.
We will always think of were Mitch is but we have to remember as long as he is here in our hearts he is here with us in person.

we suffer, but we only get stronger not weaker from this pain...<br><hr><br><b>Jen</b><br>Mitch I couldn\'t find the words to explain how i feel so i have done it by song.

A hundred days had made me older since the last time that I saw your pretty face A thousand lights had made me colder and I don’t think I can look at this the same But all the miles had separate They disappeared now when I’m dreaming of your face

I’m here without you baby but your still on my lonely mind I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time I’m here without you baby but your still with me in my dreams And tonight it’s only you and me

The miles just keep rolling as the people either way to say hello I hear this life is overrated but I hope it gets better as i go

I’m here without you baby but your still on my lonely mind I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time I’m here without you baby but your still with me in my dreams

And tonight boy it’s only you and me

Everything I know, and anywhere I go
it gets hard but it won’t take away my love
And when the last one falls, when it’s all said and done it gets hard but it won’t take away my love

I’m here without you baby but your still on my lonely mind I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time I’m here without you baby but your still with me in my dreams And tonight boy it’s only you and me

Mitchy not a day goes by that i don\'t think of you, you changed my life and i thankyou for that.
Memories are something no one can steal, they just leave are heartache no one can heal.
Forever in my heart. Love you, Jen xoxoxo

I wanna hold you high and steal your pain away
I keep your photograph; I know it serves me well
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain

\'Cause I\'m broken when I\'m open
And I don\'t feel like i am strong enough
\'Cause I\'m broken when I\'m lonsome
And i don\'t feel rite when your gone away

You\'re gone away; You don\'t feel me here anymore

The worst is over now and we can breathe again
I wanna hold you high, you steal my pain away
There\'s so much left to learn, and no one left to fight
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain

\'Cause I\'m broken when I\'m open 
And I don\'t feel like I am strong enough
\'Cause I\'m broken when I\'m lonesome
And I don\'t feel right when you\'re gone away

\'Cause I\'m broken when I\'m open
And I don\'t feel like I am strong enough

\'Cause I\'m broken when I\'m lonesome
And I don\'t feel right when you\'re gone away

\'Cause I\'m broken when I\'m lonesome
And I don\'t feel right when you\'re gone away

You\'re gone away; You don\'t feel me here anymore.

Everyone that has met the boys will know that they are both great guys and will never be forgotten no matter how many new people we meet no one will ever be able to fill their shoes, they were great guys and always will be, we will meet up with them again one day and it will be the happiest day ever but till then we have to remember the fun times we had with the boys and always remember that they would want us to think of the good times where everyone was laughing.
Stay strong and keep your chins up, both of the boys are up there now looking down on us and having a laugh and a beer remembering the good times. RIP in boys, I\'m out. xxxx

That beautiful smile, your infectious charm,not a day goes by that I dont think about you, they say only the good die young. God must of needed an angel so that must be why he took you from us so soon. I know you would not of been the same person if you had of recovered from the operation,(i think he knew that he would not fully recover) i know in my heart that you would of not wanted to live like that. i miss you so much, words can not describe the pain that im going through, everyone keeps saying it will take time, but how long is time? Mitch did so much in his short life time that many would not even dream of doing he was such a courageous person!!!  Not many people even knew Mitch had a brain tumour, with his cancer experience i know it mad him a better person also alot stronger with what he went through he always had his ups and downs but he got through them. Mitch was always helping other people through there experiences with cancer through canTeen again not many people knew the envolement he had with canTeen, Mitch loved canTeen as he was always going on camps, always meeting the chicks. Within canTeen Mitch knew when it was time to muck around and have fun and then when it was time to listen and help others,he also wore his banadanas with pride.
LOVE YOU ALWAYS xoxox<br><hr><br><b>dave\'s sister</b><br>Hi everyone, it\'s taken me this long to write on the internet. i get on and see all the lovely things written about my brother and how much we all miss him and how much we all can\'t believe that he is no longer with us.  as you know back in april dave became an uncle again and it\'s hard for me to comprehend that our boys will never be able to have the memories that we all have but i will also fill their hearts with some of the funny things that dave used to do and remind them everyday of such a wonderful bloke and a wonderful uncle.  its nearly a year and i can\'t believe it, it fells like yesterday that i remember seeing him and hearing his voice.  Just before dave left us for another world our nana was out from NZ and we were all having dinner at mum\'s house and i remember dave saying to shannon that he wanted to loose some of the fat that he had around his stomach \"too much drinken he said\" and as he said that he reach across to amy\'s plate and took the rind of fat from a piece of steak and said to amy \"i\'ll have that\" and amy said \"you want to loose weight\" and dave said \"yea but the fat is the best part of the steak\" it was so funny, mainly because of his facial expressions and his sense of humour that he had.  I\'d do anything to see him for just a few hours even minutes for him to see his new nephew.  We\'ll see you all on the 29th at the dirt park.  R.I.P. dave love you and missing you more each day. the Fitzsy family<br><hr><br><b>\"the bald and the beautiful\" in loving memory of Mitchell Searle</b><br>A shave day is being organised in loving memory of Mitchell Searle with all proceeds going to CanTeen

We choose death over innocent life
And in this world it\'s not our money that\'s evil
It\'s the ones who choose it over life
And in my heart I can not believe in this murder
And I will not be fed by the lies,
or the life that is created just to be murdered, it\'s murder

No matter how hard they try
And no matter how loud they cry
They can\'t buy their way into heaven
No matter how hard they try
And no matter how high they climb up the ladder
They won\'t reach up into heaven

And they can\'t see the innocent lives
The pointless suffering
And in my heart I wanna undo all this murder
And give back the innocent life
Open cages and stop their luxurious murder, it\'s murder

No matter how hard they try
And no matter how loud they cry
They can\'t buy their way into heaven
No matter how hard they try
And no matter how high they climb up the ladder
They won\'t reach up into heaven

Murder
Innocent life
Innocent
What have we done?

No mercy
For beautiful
Money for blood
Is murder

No matter how hard they try
And no matter how loud they cry
They can\'t buy their way into heaven
No matter how hard they try
And no matter how high they climb up the ladder
They won\'t reach up into heaven

No matter how hard they try
And no matter how loud they cry
They can\'t buy their way into heaven
No matter how hard they try
And no matter how high they climb up the ladder
They won\'t reach up into heaven, heaven, heaven.....

When you lose something you can\'t replace 
When you love someone but it goes to waste

Tears stream down your face 
When you lose something you cannot replace 
Tears streaming down your face and I 

Tears stream down your face 
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes 
Tears stream down your face and I

And ignite your bones

I feel the same way a lot of the time, particularly at this time of the year when Christmas is so near and you know that one of the people who you most loved and was most important in your life wont be around to cheer you up and make everything OK. Someone asked me a couple of weeks ago if things were getting easier as time went on - the answer was simply no, it doesnt get easier and in some ways it gets harder. Life is full of twists and turns and when the going gets tough we do need friends, family etc to get us through - talking helps and as Ive said before thank goodness for this website.

Please, if any of you feel like catching up, either ring me or call around.

My love to everyone and all the best Christmas and New Year - keep safe!<br><hr><br><b>Blake Davies</b><br>R.I.P dave we will miss u forever and we love ya mate<br><hr><br><b></b><br>As christmas approaches so soon after you Mitch, it will never be the same without you here with us all. Missing you more than ever. If i could have one gift i know what it would be, you!
All my love xoxoxoxoxoxox<br><hr><br><b>Mitch</b><br>Did I disappoint you or let you down? Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown? \'Cause I saw the end before we\'d begun, It may be over but it won\'t stop there, You touched my heart you touched my soul. You changed my life and all my goals. And love is blind and that I knew when, My heart was blinded by you. I\'ve kissed your lips and held your head, Shared your dreams. I know you well, I know your smell. I\'ve been addicted to you. Goodbye my lover. Goodbye my friend. You have been the one. You have been the one for me.I am a dreamer but when I wake,
You can\'t break my spirit - it\'s my dreams you take.And as you move on, remember me, Remember us and all we used to be I\'ve seen you cry, I\'ve seen you smile. I\'ve watched you sleeping for a while. I\'d spend a lifetime with you. I know your fears and you know mine. We\'ve had our doubts but now we\'re fine, And I love you, I swear that\'s true. I cannot live without you. Goodbye my lover.
Goodbye my friend. You have been the one. You have been the one for me. And I still hold your hand in mine. In mine when I\'m asleep. And I will bear my soul in time, When I\'m kneeling at your feet. Goodbye my lover. Goodbye my friend. You have been the one. You have been the one for me.
I\'m so hollow,I\'m so hollow.I\'m so, I\'m so, I\'m so hollow. Mitch just a little song for you.
Even everyones Christmas wishes put together can\'t bring you back and that breaks my heart. You know who this is from xoxo









<br><hr><br><b>*davey hun*</b><br>I LOVE YOU, <br><hr><br><b>Mitch - My First Christmas In Heaven</b><br>I see the countless Christmas trees around the world below 
With tiny lights, like heaven\'s stars, reflecting on the snow. 
The sight is so spectacular, please wipe away that tear, 
For I am spending Christmas with Jesus Christ this year.

I hear the many Christmas songs that people hold so dear, 
But the sounds of music can\'t compare with the Christmas choir up here.
I have no words to tell you the joy their voices bring, 
For it is beyond description to hear the angels sing.

I know how much you miss me; I see the pain inside your heart,
But I am not so far away. We really aren\'t apart.
Be happy for me dear ones. You know I hold you dear,
And glad I\'m spending Christmas with Jesus Christ this year.

I send you each a special gift from my heavenly home above. 
I send you each a memory of my undying love. After all \"Love\" is the gift; more precious than gold. 
It was always most important in the stories that Jesus told.

Please love and keep each other, as our Father said to do, 
For I can\'t count the blessings or love He has for you.
So, have a Merry Christmas and wipe away the tear.
Remember, I\'m spending Christmas with Jesus Christ this year.<br><hr><br><b>-- davey --</b><br>So where to next??

(15.1.06)</b><br>If only we could be together on yours and emily\'s birthday, we\'d start out the day with wishes and hugs and a song, so the smile in your heart would last all birthday long. We would decorate for hours with fun times and laughter and make birthday memories that we would keep forever after, We\'d celebrate sweetly with ice cream and cake. We\'d cherish each dream and each wish that you would make. Then after the sun had set we\'d find the first star to remind you how bright-shining special you are. Thinking of the fun we would have if we could share this day. Wishing you lots of birthday smiles, hugs and kisses and happines your way. The way it should be for someone who\'s as wounderful as you.

David\'s 22nd is coming up on 4th Feb and I know the emptiness on that day even more than other days.

Narz: I really like the new look on this site being different photos. Tell me, are you rotating photos as when the opening of the Dirt Park photo was up I sent my penpal in USA an email and told her to look on the website but next time I looked it was a different photo. As Im dumb at alot of computer stuff is there a way of letting my penpal know when that photo will be up again or will she have to fluke it! Thanks.<br><hr><br><b>Dean</b><br>Hey betty, the photos just get choosen randomly when you come to the site, if you press the refresh button a few times, you should probably get it again, but if you want me or narz to email them to you, let us know..
the refresh button is at the top near the back and stop buttons.<br><hr><br><b>Ryann</b><br>yes betty. its really a great photo.. its just on a random script.. so if u refresh a couple of times it WILL come up eventually.. then u can right click on it and save it if you like :)<br><hr><br><b>Betty (Dave\'s mum)</b><br>Thanks to you both. I have tried to print them off but it seems by the time I press \'print\' theres another photo there and I get something else. (Now everyone knows how dumb I can be at this internet stuff!!) I\'ll email my penpal and let her know. Thanks again.<br><hr><br><b>*****MITCH*****</b><br>A belated birthday wish to you although you & Em were in my thoughts all day...miss you mate.

No matter how good or bad the news of the day.
no matter whether the weather is beautiful or not.
No matter how many times your smile gets lost.
No matter how difficult or demanding things can be.
No matter what is happening anywhere at any time....
You will be in my thoughts and warmest wishes always.<br><hr><br><b>Meagan</b><br>God i miss you Dave.. <br><hr><br><b></b><br>late at night when im sitting there thinking of you the first thing that comes to mind is that beautiful smile of your and that laugh, i can still hear it in the back of my mind. on the days that seem worse then the one before its little things like that. that get me through.<br><hr><br><b>Daves Dad</b><br>Happy birthday for the 4th Feb Son.

Just to get on here and read what people have to say and write stuff no matter how trivial it might seem helps with healing - things would be a heck of alot tougher if we had to try to deal with things on our own.

To daves family, u dont know me, but i would like to include u in this as well because i have never seen so much courage and braveness from a family that has been through something so tragic, ur a great family to be so positive about a situation like this. everyone misses u dave, wherever we look, we r always reminded of u, whether it be someone wearing a shirt with u on it or driving past the jumps, ur all around and always will be. Im glad to have met u that once and find out how much one person can make me laugh, i was in tears mate. i\'ll always have that memory of such a great guy. well i guess ur having the last laugh, up there riding with a beer in each hand, looking down on us. im not going to say goodbye, its never goodbye, its always cya later.... everyone loves u man xoxo<br><hr><br><b>Betty Andrews</b><br>I think David\'s great sense of humour and his ability to make people smile is the one thing everyone misses. I know it is the one part of David\'s personality that both Russell and Ian would love to have and I guess if you do have that natural ability to put a smile on people\'s faces you don\'t really realise how lucky you are to be able to do that. We would all love to make the world a better place and we have to thank those few like David who have made our lives so much happier and these are the memories we need to hang onto. These are the memories that will help us get through the tough times and its nice to know that we will still be able to smile and even laugh when we remember some of David\'s antics. What a funny boy he was. Thanks so much for what you have just written - its the things like what you have just said that help us out even though it might bring a few tears. Its just great to know that David has left his memory etched in so many people - even those who only met him in passing. Thank you.<br><hr><br><b>To Mrs Andrews</b><br>Im really glad that my words helped you, even know you don\'t me. Im happy to know that i can help someone else that is feeling blue as well as myself. Stay strong and we\'ll always be here for you, thankyou for taking the time to read my statement, i do really hope that it helped.

<br><hr><br><b>i dont know who is oh boy  as above before my name</b><br><br><hr><br><b>hi mitch</b><br>thinking of you always love ya mate daniel p.<br><hr><br><b></b><br>i was saying that i had a moment and was thinking of dave. the funniest simpsons episode was on the one where lisa goes to the spelling bee and runs past barney and he goes \'thats what beer has done to me, suck it to me, suck it to me\' really fast he he he he i thought of you davey boy because i know you knew, and i know i know! you would of laughed so hard! i dont think i have ever missed you more! i love you so much xx<br><hr><br><b></b><br>how many people have to drink and drive and lose their lives before others realise thats its dangerous and it can happen to anyone. no more people need to die for us to learn this lesson, please, take this these deaths into account and realise its innocent lives and families being ruined. if u see ur mate about to get into a car drunk, do the right thing and take the keys off him. wouldn\'t u rather take ur mate home drunk and him get in trouble off his folks then the cops knocking on their door sayin he\'s in a body bag. i know this is harsh but please think before u do something that may endanger ur life or others. its not worth it to put ur family and friends through that much pain to show off in front off ur mates. and the people that push others to do these things, think do u really want one of ur mates dying for a little fun in a car. dont test the limits of ur car or ur alcohol level, ur not going to win. NO ONE IS INVINCIBLE, REMEMBER THAT!!!!! slow down and dont drink and drive, its not worth the pain.<br><hr><br><b></b><br>i miss u so much mitch. its not fair that you done nothing wrong and still your life was taken.please people slow down on the roads treasure your life.. dont throw it away by drink driving..<br><hr>

<hr><br><b>Betty (Dave\'s mum)</b><br>To the person above who wrote about the weekend\'s tragedy, yes your words are harsh and I\'m sure are well-meaning. Yes we have lost some beautiful kids in absolutely tragic circumstances and from a mum of one of these wonderful kids the effect on the family is devastating and it is with you every day. As a parent we can only imagine the pain that you all are going through again. Yes we all need to realise how precious our lives are and as young people your lives are all ahead of you - so much to enjoy. But in saying this I trust that what you have written IS based on fact and not hearsay or assumption. Somehow our kids do have to understand that life is precious and they need to take care - we as parents can\'t emphasise this enough. Our thoughts are with the families of Jack and Matt and again with all you young people. <br><hr><br><b>Rose =) jacko that ones for you!!</b><br>the pain never goes away but it does get easier with the friends we have. dave i went and sat with you last weekend before work and although it made me sad just thinkin of you makes me happy. now ive lost two more of my guy best mates and to think that they are going to be with you and mitch gives me piece of mind. matty L, i love you so much but you already know this. thankyou for everything, and jack jack jackie aka(councillor parker)the same goes for you. your ROSE (lol) will never forget you, love u!!! i dont know how im gunna go not talkin to you both every day, random msgs at all hours just to annoy each other and phone calls when one of us was bored but i\'ll be thinking of you always. i think the hardest thing for me is that when i found out, the first two people i wanted to ring, to cry on, were you two... you were always there for me...  you boys will never be forgotten, none of you, but of course you already know that too haha. its so unfair.  to every one who reads this, please drive careful, the impact, we all know really doesnt get much worse. dave matty and jacko, i\'ll always be thinking of you... i love you all and cant wait to see you again! rip it up boys and do the dilly proud!
 to all families you should be proud at how much your sons meant to us all and know that they will never be forgotten... i cant explain how so sorry i am for your loss. boys, love you loads xoxoxox<br><hr><br><b>deirdre (dave\'s sister)</b><br>I\'d like to send my sincere condolensces to the Parker and Lye family in this tragedy and letting you know that you are in my thoughts every minute.  If you ever need to talk i am here, Kirby has my number if you want to talk.  I will always be a shoulder to cry on.  I know its tough and its hard but i had support of friends and family that have lost brothers and sisters and it helps get you through a little. so give me a call i will be here to listen to you and a shoulder if you need.  To all of the mates this goes for you too.  Take care to all and our thoughts are with Jack and Matts family.<br><hr><br><b></b><br>Who was Hamish Fuller?<br><hr><br><b></b><br>Just heard about the accident. My thoughts are with Jack and Matts family. <br><hr><br><b></b><br>Hamish Fuller also died on Saturday night on Razorback. Do we know who he is?<br><hr><br><b>marilyn sayer</b><br>for the ones left to mourn.....

do not stand at their graves and weep
they are not there..they do not sleep
they are a thousand winds that blow
they are the diamond glints in snow,
they are the sunlight on ripened grain
they are the gentle autumn rain.
When you awaken in the morning hush
they are the swift, uplifting rush of
quiet birds in cicled flight
they are the soft stars that shine at night,
do not stand at their graves and cry...
they are not there..they did not die.

peace young ones ....rest.<br><hr><br><b>*amy(daves sister inlaw)*</b><br>This is for the person with the harsh words!!!!
i just wanted to say that i understand where you are coming from, but you didnt need to say anything about a body bag i dont think you would like to think of one of your family members like that.....
if you want to say things like that,  in my appinoin i think you should be brave enough to say who you are..
i agree with what you are saying totaly,I wish that they would learn.( i bet you have done stupid things in your time and probly if you are half human still do... 
 but you should practise what you preech and grow up too !!!
any mature person would have feelings towards the people reading this web page, i know it hurt me to think of something like that, having gone through it.
 no hard feelings just think next time..

i would also like to say to the familys of the people in the horrible accidents on the weekend, that iam so sorry for your loss and are thinking of you guys.....

 DEAR DAVE, I MISS YOU HEAPS.
     NOT A DAY GOES BY...   
               love you always and forever.

No matter what someone has said or done, nobody deserves to die so young.

Well I never thought I would be in this position writing this but for some reason your up there and were down here and Its going to be so hard not having yous down here with us, but the memories we shared keep you close, and the thought of us all meeting back up keeps me going. Matt I hope you realised how much of my life you really were, you were my first true love, my real best friend and that one person that could forgive me, understand me, and love me no matter what. Jacko, i\'m to miss the messy stories youd tell me, the late nights, and miss the friendship we had. In the time we all spent together the good and bad and the experiences we had, I wouldn\'t change or take back one thing. I\'m so grateful for every moment I got to spend with you two.. I don\'t know when how long it will be before I get to see you, but you guys will be on my mind and in my heart forever and I want you to know that.. I\'ll miss your friendships, I\'ll miss seeing you and Jacko round the dilly and most of all I\'m going to miss growing up with you two. Say hello to Davey, and that I miss you all too much. I hope you\'re having a great time up there together again. I miss you too much Matty but life\'s short so I guess I\'ll see you soon.
Love yous forever,
                  
                    TAZZY xoxo
<br><hr><br><b>xxNickolexx</b><br>Well, what to say, we have lost sooo many friends and all have caused so much pain and hurt. Tat & ben, your good friends of mine & i feel so much pain for the great loss of such a wonderful person (Matt). Ben, you keep living just the way Matt wanted you too!! You know i\'m always here for you guys, life wouldn\'t be the same without you. Let\'s hope your babies a boy - couldn\'t be named after better people if it is! Bec, your a great friend to me too and i never thought we\'d be catching up at such a tragic time, you keep in touch \' thinking of you. To dear Allan & Lucy, words can never be written and sounds can never be spoken to the amount of pain and loss you feel at this time. From Tat & I trying to push Matt out of the way cause he was hogging the mirror in the bathroom, making Matt pose for a photo as \'Cat in the Hat\' to turning up to your house with it packed full of people rushing everywhere will always be great memories I have and keep. I will remember you and Matt forever. Take care and i will visit soon. Miss you Matt!! Xxx<br><hr><br><b>Betty (Dave\'s mum)</b><br>Hello everyone. This is just to let you all know that Michelle and Tamara have organised a group grief loss and trauma counselling session TONIGHT 28/4/06 at 4pm at the Tahmoor Health Centre (behind the Youth Centre. Please let anyone who you think may need a bit of help know about this session. Some people may be struggling alone and it will help them if they can talk to someone who deals with grieving. Some of us can cope to some degree and can let out their emotions and some cant and its these people who probably really need to talk and listen to someone suitably trained in this area. There will be a BBQ afterwards for those who attend, which is also a way of sharing feelings, etc.

It would be a good idea to ring Michelle on 4683 2776 or 0427 488 244 so she can make sure she has enough handouts and food available.<br><hr><br><b></b><br>Hi Betty!I just wanted to say that we hope you & your family are doing ok or as well as can be expected.They say time heals but I dont think that is true,time goes on but the pain & the ache in your heart is always there.If you ever need someone to talk to please give me a call (0405177749)I would love to hear from you.You must be finding it hard with Ian away now,Im finding it very hard with Daniel being away,I miss him so much but I am so very glad that Ian & Daniel are together as I think they are helping each other with their heartache from losing Dave.It was so GOOD to have them home for Easter etc but so sad that they had to be home to farewell more good mates.Its just so tragic.My heart goes out to Jacks & Matts families as well.I rang & spoke to Deidre not long after that tragic night & asked after you but unfortunately I havent rang again as I didnt like to intrude. When I lost my Mum & Dad I found that the nights were the hardest to cope with & wouldve loved to have had somebody to just talk to.If you find that you cant sleep & need someone to listen, even if its 2,3 or 4am It wont matter just give me a call.Im a bit of a night owl anyway.It just might help to know that when your feeling down that theres someone that you can talk about Dave to at any hour, as I know I wouldve loved to have had someone to talk about Mum & Dad.So Please know that I am here & if it is what youd like to do...just pick up the phone and give me a call.
Id like to also say that I am so very very sorry that this had to happen to Dave as he is truly a very SPECIAL SON, BROTHER & FRIEND and is so very very missed by everyone that loves & knows him. Kindest Regards Gai<br><hr><br><b></b><br>bye boys... missing u forever... this sucks so much. my condolensces to the boys families n close or afar friends. its now been 18 months since our Davey Boy left us, n it still hurts so much. my thoughts go out to everyone who is grieving n has lost someone close, it really sucks. the holes left in our lives will never be replaced, but the memories will keep us going, the tears will turn into laughter (from the best memories u have left us with) soon i hope... love for always... xox oxo xox<br><hr><br><b></b><br>RIP BOYS!!!<br><hr><br><b>cara</b><br><br><hr><br><b>cara</b><br> a friend told me about this sight i didnt no any of the boys that have passed away,but  a few people i no knew them and ive seen the impact its had on them and i hate that i cant help them by just a simlpe hug or a word... , to everyone who;s been affected by this im truly sorry words cant come close to the feeling of loosing someone close to you, it hurts like hell... three years ago i lost my boyfriend in an accident, he had just left home and was going on a surfing trip to byron bay.. he never made it home to me and its been so so hard without him here, there\'s not a day that goes by where i dont think of him, somedays are good ,i think bout all the good times and love we shared and it brings the biggest smile to my face and others days im a mess... only thing i can say is   dont shut people out,, handle it together talk to peolpe and never take anyone for granted you never no when your last time with them will be.....  take care everyone, just remember yours boys would want you to be happy its hard but youll get there..RIP BOYS  you will never be forgotten im sure.watch over everyone who you love they need you... x<br><hr><br><b></b><br>if heaven calls im coming too,just like you said if you leave my life im better off dead..... i love you xxxx<br><hr><br><b>Tash</b><br>                    JACK
I carry your heart with me, i carry it in my heart. I am never without it, and anywhere i go, you go my dear. 
And whatever is done by only me, is your doing my darling. 
I fear no fate, for you are my fate my sweet. 
I want no world, for beautiful you are my world- my true...
Here is the deepest secret no-one knows, 
Here is the root of the root, the bud of the bud and the sky of the sky.. 
The tree called life which grows higher than the soul can hope, or mind can hide. 
Its the wonder that keeps the stars apart.
I carry your heart, i carry it in my heart...

This isnt getting any easier jack I miss you so much... i\'d give anything to hear your voice just one more time...

Remember when we were such fools
And so convinced and just too cool
Oh no
No no
I wish I could touch you again
I wish I could still call you, friend

For they\'re long gone
I guess I just didn\'t know how
I was all wrong

Still you said forever

I\'ll keep you locked in my head
Until we meet again

<br><hr><br><b></b><br>Has Tatiyana had the baby yet?<br><hr><br><b></b><br>The whole world was sleeping
And I was there
You could just sense this feeling in the air
Like no one\'s words were good enough to define what we feared
And no one\'s words were strong enough to fix what happened here

Lead on to save me
Lead us all there
Find me some answers
Dilly beware
Can\'t tell the difference between myth and man
Or what\'s necessary or where I should stand

The whole town is different now men have died
They can just sense this feeling in our eyes
Like no one\'s hands are big enough
To hold onto this fear
And no one\'s hands are strong enough to fix what happened here

So do we do now
Raise our voices loud
Were searching for something that cannot be found
Here open mouths
I see open hands
Blinded and silent I can\'t understand

The whole world is watching with one blank stare
I can just sense this feeling of ill-repair
Like no ones heart is full enough
To keep away this fear
And no ones heart is strong enough to fix what happened here

Lead on to save me
Lead us all there
Find me some answers
Its time that you cared
Cant tell the difference between myth and man
Or what\'s necessary or where I should stand

So do we tell now
Raise our voices loud
We\'re searching for something that cannot be found
I hear open mouths
And I see open hands
Like the blinded and silent I can\'t understand.<br><hr><br><b></b><br>no she hasn\'t had it yet,
still waiting. x<br><hr><br><b>chris\'s song</b><br>From the hands of a young boy, to the wings of an angel, you will find the same soul still breathing. who has set site on the whispering wind, i\'m sure you will find two souls still living.
dont want to let you go, from gods hands does this show, could you reach inside my souls and hold it, if you showed your face would i see it? If i said goodbye would you hear it?
From our eyes a tear falls, into these hands we held through hard times, through the good times. on the eve of this darkness together we will walk the morning and thaw in the sunshine, we\'ll keep walking. how long will these tears flow? will i ever see them go? but if i dig beneath this soul I know i wil find your gold and ill treasure memories i\'ll breathe them, if you said goodbye would i hear it. Where have you run away to? when will the sun shine through?
it\'s time to let you go, before you say goodbye please know, as a life is lost another one is born, your loved ones will mourn, but we will see you through the eyes of a new born
as we say goodbye please hear it..

Step inside and it\'s cold,

This feels wrong.

Being without your smile feels wrong. 
I\'ve been without your smile too long, too long.

Feelings lie on the floor,
Thinking nothing at all,
Put my hand to the door,
Switch the light on the wall,

But I do notice,
Just one thing I miss,
What I know is this

Being without your smile feels wrong.
I\'ve been without your smile too long, too long.

(come back home, come back home, whoa)

Being without your smile feels wrong
I\'ve been without your smile too long, too long, 
too long, too long, too long, too long, too long, too long, too long

And oh I scream for you 
Hurry I\'m fallin\', I\'m fallin\' 


Show me what it\'s like 
To be the last one standing 
And teach me wrong from right 
And I\'ll show you what I can be 
Say it for me 
Say it to me 
And I\'ll leave this life behind me 
Say it if it\'s worth saving me 
Hurry I\'m fallin\' 

Say it for me 
Say it to me 
And I\'ll leave this life behind me 
Say it if it\'s worth saving me
	
Missing u Jack, Let Me Know its Ok xx<br><hr><br><b></b><br>Hamish,
Just thinking about the day you got your new sticker on the back of your ute...
You were so excited I walked out of work and there you were standing at the bottom of the stairs waiting for me. Jumping up and down screaming with excitement.
Threw me over your shoulder and sprinted the whole way to your car.
I\'ll never forget your cheeky smile or your gorgeous eyes.
I want to stop hurting so much but I cant.
I always expect to see you drive past on your way to footy training. Or see you when i\'m out somewhere.
Knowing that it will never happen is to hard to take. I miss you Hamish. x<br><hr><br><b></b><br>It Doesnt Get Any Easier.
<br><hr><br><b></b><br>everyone is saying goodbye to all the great boys we know and have come to love so so much, n i guess that all i can say is goodbye my sweetie pie boys, all our precious memories will always be with us, everyday we will remember another memory, or jus the beautiful characters you all were, but i am so glad to have known you, n to have had you impact on my life the way you have... i feel bad however because hamish lived on my road and i did not get to know him, and from the things people have said about him makes me realise i missed out on knowing another great dilly boy... please take care... we all love you boys so much, always loved... u can never be replaced not erased from our lives. so much love and respect out to our fine and hott and sweet and funny and everything else that they were just perfect boys..

And now he lives in heaven But I know they let him out To take care of me...
I miss your love I miss your touch But I\'m feeling you every day And I can almost hear you say \'You\'ve come a long way baby\'....
In my darkest hour I know you are there Kneeling down beside me Whispering my prayer...

It was 3 AM When you woke me up Then we jumped in the car and drove as far as we could go Just to get away We talked about our lives Until the sun came out And now I\'m thinking about How I wish I could go back Just for one more day One more day with you Everytime I see your face Everytime you look my way It\'s like it all falls into place Everything feels right Ever since you walked away It left my life in disarray All I want is one more day it\'s all I need Is one more day with you When the car broke down We just kept walking along \'Til we hit this town There was nothing there at all But that was all ok We spent all our money On stupid things But if I look back now I\'d probably give it all away Just for one more day One more day with you Everytime I see your face Everytime you look my way It\'s like it all falls into place Everything feels right Ever since you walked away It left my life in disarray All I want is one more day 
It\'s all I need Is one more day with you Now I\'m sitting here Like we used to do I think about my life And now there\'s nothing I won\'t do Just for one more day One more day with you Everytime I see your face Everytime you look my way It\'s like it all falls into place Everything feels right Everytime I hear your name Everytime I feel the same It\'s like it all falls into place 
Everything, everything feels right You walked away Just one more day It\'s all I need Is one more day with you 
  I JUST WANT ONE MORE DAY!!!!!
that was so us, every friday night... what i\'d give for one more msg \" oi tash, wat u doing?\" at 2 in the morning.. i miss you so much gorgeous boy...Love you forever, Tashy...xxxx
 <br><hr><br><b></b><br>Whenever I needed someone to talk to
You were always there.
My eyes filled with tears, my heart filled with pain, and You were always there.
There was no time when I had doubt
to come to you because
You were always there.
I could see in your eyes you wanted to help, and that you really care

Whenever I was down and blue
You were always there.
No matter my problems, or what was wrong
You were always there.
Whenever I felt like nothing matters
You were always there.

Now your gone, and I don\'t know what to do
I close my eyes and think of you, and how
You were always there.
It\'s hard to look at the pictures, and get memories of you
Can you hear me now
At night I pray, and I speak to you
I guess you were right when you told me no matter how far you were
You would always be there.
I know one day I\'ll see you again, but till then I have to say goodbye

Even though it hurts to hear your name, and speak of you
One thing I will always say is
You were always there.

thanks for being our friends... love you boys so much xxx ash


<br><hr><br><b>M</b><br>Does ne1 know who was the 21 year old who was killed yesterday in picton??<br><hr><br><b></b><br>he was an el huzri boy<br><hr><br><b></b><br>Pierre el hazouri - picton high class of 2002 would know him.<br><hr><br><b></b><br>what happened to Pierre? when was the accident? <br><hr><br><b></b><br>It was on Rememberance Drive, just up from Picton high school.

<br><hr><br><b></b><br>Pierre rest in piece.... your were a quiet but friendly guy.  Its too young to die at the age of 21.  I really think that the local council needs to look at improving our roads and giving students\' advice and courses in road safety awareness.  Everyone needs to think of the unexpected when driving and take care.  Once again rest in piece Pierre!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br><hr><br><b></b><br>miss u so much jack And Matt.... Everyday. BEautiful boys XoXoXoX<br><hr><br><b></b><br>another accident with a young guy...there is too many of these, so many boys have lost their lives on the road it is terrible...so many people have lost loved ones. too anyone who new pierre i am deeply sorry to hear what has happened and this should be teaching every1 to be so much more careful on the roads because there are to many accidents wit young people these days R.I.P pierre jack matt hamish<br><hr><br><b></b><br>Oh my god boys what can i say........
To many lives have been taken away from us so soon and so young.<br><hr><br><b>Pierre el hazouri</b><br>to the el hazouri family
                        my thoughts and prayers are with you as you grieve the lose of your son and brother. RIP Pierre 
xoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxox<br><hr><br><b></b><br>another young life taken from the dilly as we are left behind to deal with the heartache. as sad as it is to lose another and the pain it reminds us of all the young lost before. what will it take before we stop and start to change the actions we take life is far to special to not its our young lives lets take it into our hands to change the future. we love to all the families that have lost loved one in the dilly.  <br><hr><br><b></b><br>i understand that we need to drive carefully but if you look at the accidents that have happened they have all been exactly that an ACCIDENT, we can\'t say stop and start to change our actions, because its unstoppable, we all know that each time we get into a car or a bike that it is a risk but everyone speeds or has sped in their time. i think we should be saying; love everyone you are with, have fun, be careful, let everyone know that u love them, and do everything that you have ever dreamt of doing... don\'t let anything stop you from accomplshing your dreams, and live life as full as you can... i miss the boys so so much, and iam pretty sure everyone does... do drive carefully, life is very precious guys we only have one shot at it as us... with love xoxox mwahhz boys xoxox <br><hr><br><b></b><br>LOST 4 WORDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<br><hr><br><b></b><br>when will this get easier... matty and jacko and dave... xxx
<br><hr><br><b></b><br>If I knew it would be the last time 
That I\'d see you fall asleep, 
I would tuck you in more tightly 
and pray the Lord, your soul to keep. 

If I knew it would be the last time 
that I see you walk out the door, 
I would give you a hug and kiss 
and call you back for one more. 

If I knew it would be the last time 
I\'d hear your voice lifted up in praise, 
I would video tape each action and word, 
so I could play them back day after day. 

If I knew it would be the last time, 
I could spare an extra minute 
to stop and say \"I love you,\" 
instead of assuming you would KNOW I do. 

If I knew it would be the last time 
I would be there to share your day, 
Well I\'m sure you\'ll have so many more, 
so I can let just this one slip away. 

For surely there\'s always tomorrow 
to make up for an oversight, 
and we always get a second chance 
to make everything just right. 

There will always be another day 
to say \"I love you,\" 
And certainly there\'s another chance 
to say our \"Anything I can do?\" 

But just in case I might be wrong, 
and today is all I get, 
I\'d like to say how much I love you 
and I hope we never forget. 

Tomorrow is not promised to anyone, 
young or old alike, 
And today may be the last chance 
you get to hold your loved one tight. 

So if you\'re waiting for tomorrow, 
why not do it today? 
For if tomorrow never comes, 
you\'ll surely regret the day, 

That you didn\'t take that extra time 
for a smile, a hug, or a kiss 
and you were too busy to grant someone, 
what turned out to be their one last wish. 

So hold your loved ones close today, 
and whisper in their ear, 
Tell them how much you love them 
and that you\'ll always hold them dear <br><hr><br><b></b><br>wow that\'s realli sweet.... n so so true.... with love to our dilly boys, the boys that have stolen all our hearts, we love you all.... love always n forever.... xoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxox <br><hr><br><b></b><br>You took my hand
You showed me how
You promised me you\'d be around
Uh huh
That\'s right
I took your words
And I believed
In everything
You said to me
Yeah huh
That\'s right

If someone said three years from now
You\'d be long gone
I\'d stand up and punch them up
Cause they\'re all wrong
I know better
Cause you said forever
And ever
Who knew

Remember when we were such fools
And so convinced and just too cool
Oh no
No no
I wish I could touch you again
I wish I could still call you friend
I\'d give anything

When someone said count your blessings now
For they\'re long gone
I guess I just didn\'t know how
I was all wrong
  

 
 




They knew better
Still you said forever
And ever
Who knew

Yeah yeah
I\'ll keep you locked in my head
Until we meet again
Until we
Until we meet again
And I won\'t forget you my friend
What happened

If someone said three years from now
You\'d be long gone
I\'d stand up and punch them out
Cause they\'re all wrong and
That last kiss
I\'ll cherish
Until we meet again
And time makes
It harder
I wish I could remember
But I keep
Your memory
You visit me in my sleep
My darling
Who knew
My darling
My darling
Who knew
My darling
I miss you

Tash- oh and the person who asked for pics of jack n matty, they were gorgeous.. especially jacky babe!xoxox<br><hr><br><b></b><br>betty your strength and encouragement still continues to amaze me... your a blessing to this community and have really helped me personally through these tough times simply by reading what you have to stay on this site and how positive you are.... thanks! xoxo<br><hr><br><b>Daves Dad</b><br>Last Thursday night was a bit of a shock to the organisers and the older ones present when the groups came back from their sessions and the younger ones came back with the system being to soft on young offenders. There is certainly a need for you all to look out for each other. This is an easy solution to a complex situation. If it seems wrong, it probably is. Do not just accept it say something or do something. Look after each other. I like other parents and community members hope something positive comes from the night. If we only manage to save one it is better than doing nothing. There was some great ideas put forward for council to follow through on. Take care everyone. <br><hr><br><b></b><br>7 years for coward who killed the beautiful andrea and carmel of buxton.<br><hr><br><b></b><br>7 Years is that all!!!
Murderer should be LIFE!<br><hr><br><b>Betty</b><br>I heard that on the radio this morning - actually said he could have his licence back in 6 years. Makes you wonder about the justice system.<br><hr><br><b>no name</b><br> i used to no jack parker, me n him used to b good mates untill he got older n was in high school and i was in primary, after thht we didnt talk much. i remember when we always used to go down to the jumps down in picton with cowboy and the brethrons and stuff and jump. and wen we used to go 2 the jumps down along stonequarry crrek in picton. but although we didnt talk much anymore i still miss him now heaps and miss seeing him round. well R.I.P jack,dave and hamish<br><hr><br><b></b><br>I am not denying that it is sad and a great loss to our community, but i dont think it was murder, i dont think anyone intentionally sets out to hurt or kill someone when they are driving - i dont know the circumstances of the Carmel and Andrea case, but the person who killed the beautiful girls may have remorse - and in that case i dont think its fair to call them a murderer... We are not the only ones who have to live with the pain - the person who was in the other car also has to live with the pain of knowing he has broken two families with a pain that can never be mended.<br><hr><br><b></b><br>i thought there was only one car involved in Andrea n Carmels accident? am i wrong? <br><hr><br><b>i miss you guys so so much....</b><br>love you all forever.... i  wish  we  didnt  drift  apart  in  the  end....  i  am  sorry  for  that.... <br><hr><br><b></b><br>There was only one car involved - 3 ppl in it.<br><hr><br><b></b><br>There is no Justice in it. He was doing over 200k/ph and he jumped the railway lines in buxton. He deserves to rot in Jail. He also cowardly ran from the accident and left the girls there.
Now think about it does he really have remorse? 
There was only one car involved! He was also i drunk driver! he deserves no pitty..
<br><hr><br><b></b><br>lives and futures were changed the night of that accident, and people want us to show pitty. i agree with the above if he had remorse why did he leave the seen why didnt he call for help. nothing will bring the girls back, but i cant understand how the legal system can fail them so badly, and to think he will be aloud to drive again even before he is out walking with the people he hurt so badly. this is the justice system were meant to have faith in!!!!<br><hr><br><b>ian </b><br>sorry i haven\'t really been on here dave i still cant come to terms mit everything going on, it really good to hear that evrybody supports everybody else, i miss u so much y cant we go back to the days we helped paint the house in vegemite n u bashing the crap out of me on the lounges so many fond memories my brother, like the time u fell out of the tree at roches place n ripped ur groin open on trying to catch cicartars, u would do nefin to put a smile on nebodies face, u will always be my supper man, i fonud sum photo\'s of u n cam in granma dilly undies i forgot u done to hot4s photo shoots i thoiught it ws just the 1 wit u n squiz n the pintara, like i said bro so mny fond memories n not 1 bad 1 every moment i spent wit u i cheerish, no matter wat time or what distance between us dilly boys awlays stay dilly boys,only the good die young my supreman,

<br><hr><br><b></b><br>why do people say things will only get easier? i dont understand cos they arent, its still all fresh in my mind. why does something bad always happen to the people that dont deserve it that havent done anything wrong. I just dont understand some things anymore, im trying to deal with it but its just way to hard, just wish i could see your smiling face one more time. Hey darl do you remember the time when we were supposed to be in some music concert one night at school, we got bored so we decided to wander the school and ended up setting off all the alarms and all the police came-oops, pretty fun though,i still claim it was your fault ofcourse, hehe.. wat i wouldnt give to be there again just to spend time with you. it really hurts me to know that your not coming back, not going to give me one more hug, not going to keep tellin me \"chin up sweety\" when things are getting tough, wish the pain would just go away. I always remember you use to do things to annoy me on purpose like if you were behind me in the canteen line ud think it would be funny to pick me up and put me behind you so you got there quicker -u cheeky bugger. il never forget you i promise there will always be a place in my heart for you, i never stop thinking bout you, luv ya always please watch over me and keep me safe luv you gorgeous xxx<br><hr><br><b></b><br>hey ian, we;re all behind ya kid... miss ya lots.... <br><hr><br><b></b><br>pics of matty and jacko?
<br><hr><br><b>Betty</b><br>Well, Ive had a few tears again reading all the messages, some tears with a smile on my face...memories of what a bugger David could be...no harm meant with any of his pranks...just a funny boy. 
Ill get onto the photos of the boys, and I wonder if people could write who the messages are from as its nice to see who actually is writing things on here, eg who was it that picked the person up in the canteen line..our boys all had wicked senses of humour. What memories we had and its great to keep them coming. This was the first time Ian has been on here and I know it was hard, but reading what he wrote takes me back and puts a smile on my face. Ian...whats with the vegemite story!

for every time you sheltered me from harm
you showed me truth
kept me warm
every time you left me on the street
i found my way
i found my feet

tell me you\'ll always be
there to pull me free
there to rescue me

 <br><hr><br><b>Betty (David\'s mum)</b><br>I have been looking on the internet at verses today and came across this:
MEMORIES ARE GOLDEN:
They say memories are golden, well maybe that is true, We never wanted memories, we only wanted you. A million times we needed you, a million times we cried, If love alone could have saved you, you never would have died. In life we loved you dearly, in death we love you still. In our hearts you hold a place no-one could ever fill.

Ive found a good site for verses and will put some on from time to time.

Ive been reading some of the verses Ive found to try to cheer me up and found this one: HE IS GONE: You can shed tears that he is gone, Or you can smile because he lived, You can close your eyes and pray that he will come back, Or you can open your eyes and see all that he has left. Your heart can be empty because you cant see him Or you can be full of the love that you shared, You can turn your back on tomorrow and live yesterday, Or you can be happy for tomorrow because of yesterday. You can remember him and only that he is gone Or you can cherish his memory and let it live on, You can cry and close your mind be empty and turn your back, Or you can do what he would want: smile, open your eyes, love and go on. We do have our memories and can smile at some of the antics our boys got up to - but it is hard when all you want is to grab hold of them and give them a great big cuddle and tell them how much you love and miss them. Just also to let the Searles know Im thinking of them especially at this time. My love to everyone.<br><hr><br><b></b><br>what have we got planned to remember Mitch by on the day?<br><hr><br><b></b><br>Hey Betty, whats the website where you get the poems from???<br><hr><br><b>Betty</b><br>I dont go to any particular site - Im not real clever with internet stuff! I just enter in something like \'verses to remember\' or \'poems of compassion\' or something like that. These usually bring up sites where you can look at various types of verse.

I think about you all the time, sending you all my love xxx<br><hr><br><b></b><br>we have always had that special bond. that only brothers and sisters share. we grew together knowing there was always someone there. as kids if one got into trouble they always knew the other was there to put uit right. Then came the teenage years and the problems changed but we all stood together and took on the fight of our lives, we supported each other right up until the end, and that still remains unchanged to this day. i may not have always told you how much it really meant to have a brother such as you. you were surely sent from heaven.
I know there were times we may have passed an angry word but never did i even think that you didnt care you always did. Mitch you mean more to me than words could even say. that special childhood bond that binded us closer and stronger everyday. I know no matter where i go or what i do you will always be close by.

Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high,
There\'s a land that I heard of
Once in a lullaby. 
Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue,
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true
Someday I\'ll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far
Behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Till we all meet again in such a beautiful place

Only if God could see how he could of turned out to be. He wasn\'t the only one to pay, I still cry to this day.
Sometimes I envision him in my mind
As clear as I would in a mirror
I only hope he knows
that no matter where in life I go
I love him so much
I only wish I could feel his touch. 
Only if God could see
how much he meant to me
I never told him how much I cared
or how much I enjoyed the things we shared
all of mind is filled with hate
because I never told him of my love
and now it\'s too late
<br><hr><br><b>Joel Fittler.</b><br><br><hr><br><b></b><br>You meant so much to all of us
You were special and that\'s no lie
You brightened up the darkest day
And the cloudiest sky

Your smile alone warmed hearts
Your laugh was like music to hear
I would give absolutely anything
To have you well and standing near

Not a second passes
When you\'re not on our minds
Your love we will never forget
The hurt will ease in time

Many tears I have seen and cried
They have all poured out like rain<br><hr><br><b>Joel Fittler</b><br>Hamish Is someone i will never forget. i still sit on the train every morning and think of all the stupid shit we did & all the good times we had.

Our hearts are breaking,
our thoughts are going wild!
We\'ve lost our friend:
We\'ve lost our child!
<br><hr><br><b>Kay Hill</b><br>What an amazing site!  I met Dave\'s Mum and subsequently, his family through an ebay sale...bizzarre!!!  I quickly learnt a lot about Dave and the impact he had on the community, his family and friends.  Quite honestly, I am still coming to terms with the concept of someone so young having such a positive impact on so many people.  Deidre warned me to have tissues in hand if I logged on to this site....fool me for not listening!!!  And not only has David, but the other young people in the area who have so many friends and have affected so many people in their young lives.  I feel so sad now at all your losses and although I feel truly lucky for my wonderful family, the many comments above, have put clearly in perspective for me, the reality that being there for each other is one of the most important things you can do...to make no judgement and enjoy life!!  I will now go and wash my face, try to look like I havent cried for the last hour + and get ready to welcome my gorgeous husband and two beautiful children when they come home.  I am blown away that a collecion of complete strangers have impacted me so strongly and made a reality of what I so often say - but rarely do!!  Thank you.  May happiness, health and love surround you always. <br><hr><br><b>Xxx.Mitch.xxX</b><br>12months have come and gone since you left our world. if i had one wish to make it would be that of that our two worlds the one you left and the one your now in could meet only for a moment to see you smiling face one more time and to hear your laugh just one more time. as you now rest your eyes, we go on with you in every thought. take care love you alwaysxxx<br><hr><br><b>deirdre dave\'s sister</b><br>Hi dave not a day goes by that i don\'t think of you, i struggle everyday it hurts to go down and see you.  I know that you are with me and looking after me and my 2 boys (your georgous nephews) on of whom you haven\'t met but mate but you have come back to haunt me with him in soooo many ways. His temprament, his appearance, his jet black hair, his big dimples and that smile that we loved sooo much from you has come back in him. Which i am truely grateful for.  I just needed to let you know that i am always thinking of you even though i don\'t go and see you i just can\'t do it.  i am truely grateful that i had you as a brother and that you were one of a kind and loved by so many people.  Just to let you know sean called Brody (your youngest nephew) FATTY the other day and i just burst into tears as that was my nickname for you and now that has been transfered to your nephew, i\'m truely grateful for both my boys and knowing that you will always be looking from above and keeping an eye on them, they couldn\'t have wished for a better guardian angel.  Take care up there wherever you are and i just wanted to let you know that i love you and miss you heaps.

I will sort them and give a couple to Ryan to put on the site. Drive safe<br><hr><br><b>Lucy - Matt\'s Mum</b><br>Wow - Dave, Mitch, Hamish, Matt and Jack are so so lucky to have the friends they have.  I use present tense because I cannot seem to use past tense as they will all never leave us.  The tears have not been able to stop, reading everything that you have all said about the boys.
I would like to thank Betty and Ross and Ian for all the help and support they have given us. Also all of Matt\'s friends - because without you guys Matt would not have been the person he was funny, gorgeous, cheeky, loving, serious,emotional, caring I could go on forever describing him (I am sure he would lov hearing all these things about himself) No it does not get easier it gets harder, I find Friday and Saturday nights really hard, as there is not the constant procession of friends in and out of the house of the constant use of  Matthews second favourite room in the house (the bathroom and the main thing in there of course was the mirror) is so so so quite.
I miss opening the rumpus room door on Sunday morning and there was bodies everywhere. I miss all of you being there. I know I would do the normal mother things and rant and rave a bit, but I must have been doing something right as Matt said \"he never wanted to leave home\"-(he lied to me - I never never ever ever thought this would happen). I still see Dave standing in my kitchen with that beautiful smile and I miss Jack wandering in saying Hi Luce hows it going. I miss Matt saying looking good Luce or I luv you mum. I know on Mothers Day I brought one of the old cards he had brought me - as he got older he always brought me a really funny card.  Lucky I have kept all the cards he ever brought me (thats a thing mothers do) I remember laughing at Matt that night he had brought a new jacket with fur around the collar - what a girl!  I wish but I could have given him one more kiss, one more cuddle, I lie one more would not have been enough.  The photos have been sent to Ross of Matt and Jack. As I am typing this \"Three Wise Men\" are playing on the radio, I always think of Dave, Matt and Jack.
Yes there is a feeling of emptyness and there is a part of me missing, just like it is with all of you.  I am so so lucky that Matthew had such great, caring, fun loving friends.  Maybe you could write down some of the funny times you shared.  I am so pleased that some of the crazy things the boys did where videoed.  I was lucky enought to be a handed a video of Matt riding a push bike stark naked - (I wont say who the other person was - its our secret).  I haven\'t been able to sit down and watch all of it yet still too emotional, but I am so glad that some of these crazy things were videoed.
Its funny I feel better writing on this site. 
If anyone has any photos of the boys at all these parties they attened I would love to get them and do some copies as I would like to put something together for Karen and Wayne also.  If anyone has a photo of Matt in his Coles work shirt I would love to get a copy of it for his day. I am so proud of my son and also of the great friends he has - our family is always there for all of you. As a mother you can nearly fix everything but I hate this as I cannot change of fix it!!!!  Luv u Matt forever and ever Mum  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
<br><hr><br><b></b><br>hey lucy, we should be thankin you for letting us eat you out of house and home and yes yes not always waking us up on those sunday mornings when a heap of us were recovering infront of the tv lol... and your right matt always stirred you he\'d never leave, lol except to the garage but of course then he would\'ve had to go further to steal your hairspray!!!! :-) ill come visit again soon.. take care! ashley xoxo<br><hr><br><b>Tasha</b><br>hey jacky baby, havnt posted for a while... it sometimes gets to the point where im lost for what to say..\'im missing you\' doesnt seem to be enough to describe what im feeling. over 4 months since u and matty have been gone, and no, time does not make it any easier. sometimes i jus sit and stare at photos of u and think.. i have done so much with u, i have shared so many memories, thoughts and dreams, and who can i talk to about all of that?? u cant talk about things shared jus between 2 people becuase they dont understand, they cant feel it.. only u could. i wonder so much if u can see me or hear me and then i get angry that u wont show me if u can.. i still sleep with ur pants and my \'jack doll\' becuz i feel like a part of u is there with me in the night..and i ask u to hug me to sleep, i wonder if u do? its true that i will never be the same person that i was when u were alive, purely due to the fact that u were one of the biggest parts of my life, u affected the things i did, u inspired me so much that u will never know. i truely belive that i will never find another jack, how could i, there is no1 in the world like u.. and im glad becuz i would never ever want anyone to take ur place, and even when i am older and my life changes, there is one thing that will never change, and that is my love for you. i cant even begin to describe how lucky i feel that i got to be a part of your life.. i\'ll never forget the endless conversations, about nothing at all... i could talk to u for hours and hours and we would always be able to find something to keep talking about, half the time if we werent together we\'d jus put on the same tv channel and watch tv while still bein on the phone, then comment on things that were happening. its hard not to cry when i think of you, and sometimes no matter what i jus lock myself in my room and scream and cry until i have no more energy to do anything else but fall to sleep. its like there is no escape from u, everywhere i go there is something stickin out with ur name on it, or something that u liked. i hate the fact i cant talk to u when im feelin like shit, but it seems these days that the only reason im feelin like that is becuz im missing u unbareably. i hope and pray so much that ur still around somewhere.. but no matter what ur not with me now and thats what hurts the most.i feel like i have learnt one of the hardest lessons that life has to give, life isnt great, life doesnt work out how u want it to, or think that it will.. and no matter what u cant control it or prevent it..it angers me that i have to do this, i look at people who dont have to feel this and im so envious.. but then i realise that there is so many people who have to feel like this, many that are feeling even worse and i dont know how they can, and atleast now i can understand the pain they have to go through.. im jus so greatful that u have the best family ever, and i know i cam go and cry with them anytime.. i think u were such a great person becuz of them jack and im sooo glad i get to still spend time with them becuz they make me feel close to u..i miss my convos with matt, i miss the way he would bag me out about my obsession with u! and he would always send me things from e-bay to check out haha, its hard bein around this town, without u two.. im envious of all the people who get to be with you now in heaven.. make sure u save a spot for me boys.  im always dreaming of you jack...i hope i never stop dreaming of you becuz its the only place that i can be with you. Love you so much XXX<br><hr><br><b>Lucy</b><br>We have to thank God for one thing, its being able to have memories and being able to dream also photos, even though sometimes it hurts so so much to look at photos.We have also got to remember that we are so so lucky we were a part of their lives and we are special because they chose us all to be in their lives.  Now I definately know what they mean when they say something has a \"domino effect\", think of two rows of domino\'s going on and on on, one falls and the others keep falling, the number of lives effected by both the boys is incredible. Tasha my heart goes out to you, I know what it was like to loose someone you loved.  Just remember even if anyone tried to replicate what they had said or done even a few minutes ago it would never be the same thing, you have so so so many special memories, you are lucky because no one else has those same memories or feelings or moments of laughter only you and Jack had those. Jack is so so lucky to have your luv and Matt was a little shit for bagging you out,but you do know he liked stirring everyone, even though he was very sensitive, a side to him that I knew.  Our lives will never be the same and this town will never be the same, they talk about a water drought, boy over the years the Wollondilly area would have filled a huge huge dam for all the tears we have shed for the boys and girls we have lost in the area. Matt would be saying to me that\'s enough mum you are getting too sloppy.  Luv xxxxxxxxxx<br><hr><br><b></b><br>Hey Boys, its been way too long since we have seen your smiling faces and all i keep thinking about is how long will it be til we can see them again..

Drive Safe<br><hr><br><b>Betty (David\'s mum)</b><br>Oh dear, more tears today just looking at these photos and seeing our 3 wisemen having one of their many great times with mates. It seems so long ago that I could look through photos and get a buzz out of our kids enjoying themselves (and making everyone else around them laugh!)without that hollow emptiness underlying everything. Now I look at them and while I smile I wish more than anything on earth we could turn back the clock and change things!! 
..Somewhere in our dreams tonight we\'ll see you standing there, You look at us with a smile \"Life isn\'t always fair\". You say you were chosen for his garden, His preciously hand picked bouquet. \"God really needed us, That\'s why we couldn\'t stay\". It\'s said to be that angels Are sent from up above. We\'ve always had our angels, Our boys - whose hearts were filled with love. We love and miss you all so much.<br><hr><br><b>Mitch </b><br>-Mitch just a song for you, always missing you- It feels like rain has ran down on my face As you close your eyes for the last time Why can\'t we travel back in time I wrote this song tonight for you So you\'d hear it everyday And know you\'re on my mind I wanna hold you in my arms and Watch you sleep until tomorrow Your silent sleep is pure beauty I wish our lives were movies So I could hit stop rewind Replay our favourite scenes And take out the bad dreams Repeat all the parts with you and me I could see you everyday As we travel back in time Some day I\'ll see you in heaven I feel you\'re everywhere around me These dreams that keep me up all night They replay these memories over in my mind I wrote this song tonight for you I\'d give anything, anything To see you one more time I wanna hold you in my arms and Watch you sleep until tomorrow Your silent sleep is pure beauty I wish our lives were movies 
So I could hit stop rewind Replay our favourite scenes And take out the bad dreams Repeat all the parts with you and me I could see you everyday 
As we travel back in time Some day I\'ll be with you in heaven Now you\'re gone, your story lives on Life\'s a movie Life\'s a movie Now you\'re gone, your story lives on Life\'s a movie My life\'s a movie....

LETTER TO MUM AND DAD: Please do not feel guilty It was just my time to go. I know that you are feeling sad, And the tears just seem to flow. I dont want you to keep crying You are shedding so many tears. We all come to earth for a lifetime, But for some its not many years. I havent really left you Even though it may seem so, I have just gone to my heavenly home, And Im closer that you know. I know you long to see me, But theres nothing I can do. Just believe me when I say this, \"Im right there next to you.\" Ill send you little messages So please try and understand, For when your time is ready, Ill be there to take your hand.

<br><hr><br><b>mitch</b><br>miss you always <br><hr><br><b>Tash</b><br>Tomorrow used to be a day away
Now love is gone and youre into someone far away.
I never thought the day would come
When I would see her hand, not mine,
holding onto yours because I could not find the time.

Now I cant deny
nothing lasts forever
I dont want to leave
and see the tear drops in your eyes
I don’t want to live to see the day we say goodbye
I just wanna touch you Boy
I wanna feel you close to me
Without your love I would give up now
and walk away so easily.

So maybe while we\'re young
We’ll figure out together
that even with the pain, there’s a remedy
and we’ll be all right
I don’t want to live to see the day we say goodbye.

When I first met you I couldn’t love anyone
oh, but you stole my dreams and you made me see
that I can walk under the sun
and I can still be me
and now I can’t deny nothing lasts forever.

But I don’t want to leave and see the teardrops in your eyes
So baby while we’re young let’s figure out together
that even with the pain there’s a remedy
and we’ll be all right.
I don’t want to live to see the day we say goodbye,
we say goodbye, oh goodbye, goodbye.
** i miss you so much jack ** xoxoxo<br><hr><br><b>  ~~IF I KNEW~~</b><br>If I knew it would be the last time That I\'d see you fall asleep, I would tuck you in more tightly 
and pray the Lord, your soul to keep. If I knew it would be the last time that I see you walk out the door, I would give you a hug and kiss and call you back for one more If I knew it would be the last time I\'d hear your voice lifted up in praise, I would video tape each action and word, 
so I could play them back day after day. If I knew it would be the last time,! I could spare an extra minute to stop and say \"I love you,\" instead of assuming you would KNOW I do. If I knew it would be the last time I would be there to share your day, Well I\'m sure you\'ll have so many more, so I can let just this one slip away. For surely there\'s always tomorrow to make up for an oversight, and we always get a second chance 
to make everything just right. There will l always be another day to say \"I love you,\" And certainly there\'s another chance to say our \"Anything I can do?\" But just in case I might be wrong, and today is all I get, I\'d like to say how much I love you and I hope we never forget. Tomorrow is not promised to anyone, young or old alike, And today may be the last chance you get to hold your loved one tight So if you\'re waiting for tomorrow, why not do it today? For if tomorrow never comes, you\'ll surely regret the day, That you didn! \'t take that extra time 
for a smile, a hug, or a kiss and you were too busy to grant someone, what turned out to be their one last wish. So hold your loved ones close today, and whisper in their ear, Tell them how much you love them and that you\'ll always hold them dear Take time to say \"I\'m sorry,\" 
\"Please forgive me,\" \"Thank you,\" or \"It\'s okay.\" 
And if tomorrow never comes, you\'ll have no regrets about today. 

Life is to short we have all lost so much i hope this is a little reminder for people to cherish what was and what is.
Jen xoxo

It would be so much beta if you were here with Mitch, Jacko and Matty and drinking with all your mates, and we didn\'t have to \"talk\" to you through this. I miss you so. I just wish things were so much different. You guys were the ones we always looked out for when we went out to a party or anywhere. The ones that would make any girl smile, and everyone LAUGH, yous had amazing personalities each one of you had something different and special about you that made us love you as much as we do. Our lives have been left with holes, but I am so glad to have met you all and shared some memories with you, not as many as I would have liked but hey, I\'ll see yas again, we all will. To the Andrew Family we are thinking of you guys at this time. We love you guys. Stay Strong- by the way Happy 21st Ian, I hope you were ok and had a good day. LOVE you DILLY BOYS!!! Take care everyone. Lots of Love... Xxx <br><hr><br><b>Betty</b><br>Yes its hard to begin to comprehend that it is almost 2 years since we saw Davids face and watched his crazy antics which made us all laugh - live was soooooo much better then. For anyone who can get their hands on the 9th October Womans Day have a look on one of the pages a couple in from the back and you will see Davids double. Ask Dean Wall my reaction when he showed me, I almost collapsed, I thought it WAS David. I surprised Ian with a flying visit for his 21st which was on Tuesday. He is living in a nice part of the world at the moment.

I think about you all every day. I wish I could see a smile or a wave, or even you driving past me. But it doesn\'t happen. I have no idea how the families do it, you guys are so brave and strong. Our love is with all the families and with our boys. You will NEVER be forgotten. Miss you Davey, Mitch, JAcko and Matty. XoXoX<br><hr><br><b>Betty</b><br>Its hard to begin to even imagine that it is 2 years to the day since David left home and didn\'t come back. It seems like forever since he made me laugh and life in general was OK. Youre right it does\'t get any easier and we just have to make it through the best way we can. It never ceases to amaze me the impact the 4 guys had on so many people - their sense of humour and the fun times they had, their love of life and for the people around them, thats what helps us through knowing that they made the best of the time they had here. We are all the better for having them in our lives.

I have organised a photographer to come with me to the unveiling of the memorial at Campbelltown skate park on November 11 at 3.30pm. I hope you guys can make it so I can have a chat with you for the paper and we can let people know how devastating it is to lose a close friend or family member on our roads. It doesn\'t seem like two years since Mike rang me with the bad news about Dave. Still gives me goose bumps when I think about it - I can still hear his voice and remember every single word he said. I am continually amazed by the way you guys have pulled through everything you have been through. Not many kids your age have suffered the terrible loss you guys have. It\'s not fair that some people don\'t know what it\'s like to lose one friend, but you guys have lost more friends in two years than our parents have in a lifetime. I am truly amazed by your courage and I\'m so proud of you. I know the boys would be proud as well. Keep looking after each other and stay safe ok. chelle xx<br><hr><br><b>hey narz</b><br>hey pal its ian i was wondering if i cud get a copy of those photos that r on this page of all the boys please cheers pal ian <br><hr><br><b>hang in there</b><br>to all my dillians if u need someone to talk to dont hesitate to give me a call, with each othr we can all pull throu these hard times ian<br><hr><br><b></b><br>When trouble fills my world you bring me peace 
You calm me down, you’re my relief 
When walls come crashing down around my feet 
You light my way, you’re my release

When I’m in too deep 
Tell me you’ll always be 
There to pull me free 

When the sun is beating down upon my brow 
You are my shade, you cool me down 
And every time I tried to turn away 
You brought me around, in your humble way 

So say you’ll watch over me 
When I’m in too deep 
Tell me you’ll always be 
There to pull me free 
There to rescue me 

For every time you sheltered me from harm 
You showed me truth, you kept me warm 
And every time you left me on the street 
I found my way, I found my feet 

So say you’ll watch over me 
When I’m in too deep 
Tell me you’ll always be 
There to pull me free 
There to rescue me

<br><hr><br><b></b><br>Lullaby Lyrics

They didn\'t have you where I come from
Never knew the best was yet to come
Life began when I saw your face
And I hear your laugh like a serenade

How long do you want to be loved
Is forever enough, is forever enough
How long do you want to be loved
Is forever enough
Cause I\'m never, never giving you up

I slip in bed when you\'re asleep
To hold you close and feel your breath on me
Tomorrow there\'ll be so much to do
So tonight I\'ll drift in a dream with you

How long do you want to be loved
Is forever enough, is forever enough
How long do you want to be loved
Is forever enough
Cause I\'m never, never giving you up

As you wander through this troubled world
In search of all things beautiful
You can close your eyes when you\'re miles away
And hear my voice like a serenade

How long do you want to be loved
Is forever enough, is forever enough
How long do you want to be loved
Is forever enough
Cause I\'m never, never giving you up

How long do you want to be loved
Is forever enough, is forever enough
How long do you want to be loved
Is forever enough
Cause I\'m never, never giving you up
Is forever enough

in shadows hiding from the world, 
only coming out when it gets cold. 

The seas part when they hit the floor, 
the voices carry on and out the door, 
Everything you touch turns into gold. 

Like the angel, you are, 
Left creating a lightness in my chest. 
Your eyes, they penetrate me. 
Your answer\'s always \'maybe\', 
that\'s when I got up and left. 

A beating heart and a microphone, 
a ticking clock in an empty home, 
still tells of these times so long ago. 
And even though I\'ve come so far, 
I know I\'ve got so far to go, 
and any day now I\'ll explode. 

Like the angel, you are, 
Left creating a lightness in my chest. 
Your eyes, they penetrate me. 
Your answer\'s always \'maybe\', 
that\'s when I got up and left. 

And each and everyday, will lead into tomorrow, 
Tomorrow brings one less day without you. 
But don\'t wait up, just leave the light on, 
\'cause all the roads that I might take, 
will all one day lead back to you. 

Like the angel, you are, 
Left creating a lightness in my chest. 
Your eyes, they penetrate me. 
Your answer\'s too amazing, 
that\'s when I got up and left
Love you Always missing u everyday Love Always Tash

I still remember the day you came into this world.  I was so so lucky that you chose me as your mum and I know that your dad fealt the same way.  You did not have it easy but you never complained you always had that cheeky smile on your face.  Twenty three years has gone to fast I never never expected it would only be 23 years I thought it would have been forever. If only I had a few minutes more I would have told you we loved you more than all the stars in the sky,fish in the sea, with mu whole heart and soul that is how much I will love you always and forever.I know you knew you were loved and you always said you would never leave home-we must not have been too bad a parents then -we all miss you so so so much. You are remembered by so many people that was shown today with the phone calls, birthday bloons, flowers, cards, raising of glasses.  The love that has been felt for you today is so overwelming.  You are so lucky that you have so many fabulous friends and family. We could not have got through today without Jacks family, Tahnee, all your precious fantastic friends, and of cause all your family.
Thank you everyone. xxxxxxxxxxxx our three wise men are shinning in the southern cross tonight. <br><hr><br><b></b><br>Hey matty jus wishing you a happy 23rd  birthday, although its not the same we\'re all thinking of you today and everyday you will always have a very special place in all our hearts, and missing you so much.

As long as you come to me
I don\'t like illusions I can\'t see
Them clearly

I don\'t care no I wouldn\'t dare
To fix the twist in you
You\'ve shown me eventually
What you\'ll do

I don\'t mind...
I don\'t care...
As long as you\'re here

Go ahead tell me you\'ll leave again
You\'ll just come back running
Holding your scarred heart in hand
It\'s all the same
And I\'ll take you for who you are
If you take me for everything
Do it all over again
It\'s all the same

Hours slide and days go by
Till you decide to come
And in between it always seems too long
All of a sudden

And I have the skill, yeah I have the will
To breathe you in while I can
However long you stay
Is all that I am

I don\'t mind...
I don\'t care...
As long as you\'re here

Go ahead tell me you\'ll leave again
You\'ll just come back running
Holding your scarred heart in hand
It\'s all the same
And I\'ll take you for who you are
If you take me for everything
Do it all over again
It\'s always the same

Wrong or right
Black or white
If I close my eyes
It\'s all the same

In my life
The compromise
I close my eyes
It\'s all the same

Go ahead say it you\'re leaving
You\'ll just come back running
Holding your scarred heart in hand
It\'s all the same
And I\'ll take you for who you are
If you take me for everything
Do it all over again
It\'s all the same

<br><hr><br><b></b><br>its ok to be scared, its ok to be sad, its ok to feel, its ok to be confused and frustrated, its ok to be upset, to be angry. there are many things that can not be answered or questioned, left to wonder life is a journey and every moment is precious and valauble to this road taken. many people effect and shape our journey, which is why its important to not take relationships and freindships for granted. the angels that placed here to shape us leave footprints that will never be re filled...

Christmas is supposed to be a happy time for everyone but there will always be a great big empty hole inside us knowing that life will never be the same again and every day is tinged with sadness.

<br><hr><br><b></b><br>OHHH MY GOSH! This is so stupid. The Dilly is getting smaller and smaller all the time. I can\'t stand this. These are our boys and they are being taken away from us, too often. I guess its cos the Dilly has the best boys but i think enough is enough. Its too many. I hate this. I remember the day Davey left the whole town just stopped. And its been happening a lot since then. I hate seeing the boys with teary eyes and so hurt- Why can\'t they just leave our boys alone? Why does this keep happening? Just when we think that the year is nearly over and nothing can go wrong it does, it goes terribly wrong. My heart is with the Keating Family, you raised a good kid. a great kid. He was gonna go to Europe for god sake. Its the ones that have dreams and go for them that leave, the ones we love and care about so much. Then agan we love all our Dilly. I just want this to stop. When will it end? I know its not their fault, its the ones above that can\'t stop taking our boys. This is just so unfair. Its Christmas and now we are saying good bye to another precious life taken from us too soon. My heart is with all of you guys... To the Keating Family i am so sorry bout this, My love to you all. Rest In Peace Matt \"Keato\" Keating... We will love you forever and you will be dearly missed, you will be in our thoughts everyday with the rest of our DILLY BOYS.!!!!! xox With love. xox<br><hr><br><b>Bye Keato. Love you</b><br>So Keato is gone, its just so stupid- i hate how this keeps happening. thats 4 car deaths this yr, in 9 months. That just isn\'t right... There is nothing fun about this, but someone up there thinks its okz to take the people we love, BUT IT ISNT... Its MEAN! And its so unfair. Their families shouldnt have to say goodbye, or to feel this pain, this emptiness, not yet. Not now. Their friends shouldnt be left here crying. Wishing just one more time. Just one more Hi, one more hug, laugh, smile. Why won\'t it just end? Why can\'t these things just STOP. I am sick of it all. I am sick of seeing the boys upset. I am sick of all the Funeral notices. ITS JUST NOT RIGHT, NOT FAIR. Why is our DILLY getting smaller? Why is it the good ones leaving us? Why are the bad ones here still hurting us? Life just doesnt make sense sometimes. it realli doesnt. There are TOO MANY HOLES IN OUR LIVES now. TOO MANY! He was going places that boy was.

My sincere condolences to the Keating family for their sudden loss. Ian and I called in and saw Steve and Carol at home yesterday and Phil at the Greko before Ian flew up north for work. I am slowly meeting davids mates mums and dads but this is not how I want to meet them. They are all great parents so loving of the children. If any one need to talk to me you are welcome to do so on my mobile 0419 274 381 or email me on randrews@acenet.com.au. The hurt never goes away and each one of these tragedies only makes it worse. Drive safe everyone. RIP our Dilly Boys. Please no more.<br><hr><br><b>SK</b><br>Phill, 
You and your family are in my thoughts and prayers. Your brother will never be forgotton he had an awesome zest for life.
I will try and catch up with you phill next time i\'m down and give you a huge hug.<br><hr><br><b>Betty</b><br>What have our kids done to be punished so much! Like in the message above I dont want to see our kids crying ever again as a result of another one of their friends losing their life. I dont think there would be a greater bunch of kids who are friends around the WORLD who have had to suffer the ongoing tragedies in their short lives, let alone those of us who are older seeing our kids having to try to cope with all their losses. Life seems so unfair at times! As Ross has said PLEASE RING US IF ANYONE NEEDS TO TALK!!
I didnt see Keato all that often but I do have 2 memories - the first at David\'s 18th when I went up to him after he said hello to me and I said  \"Im sorry, which one of Dave\'s friends are you\", to which he replied \"Im one of the Rally twins\", but I knew he was taller than either of those boys. And the last time I spoke to him was at Jason\'s funeral a few weeks ago when we simply looked at one another and I said to him something like \"Lets hope this is the last funeral we have for one of our boys\". Unbelievable!

To all our kids left here who have again got to try to cope with a sudden tragic loss, my heartfelt sympathies to you all and if there is anything I can do to help please get in touch.

To Mathew\'s family please accept my sincere condolences and as with the kids if I can be of any help please let me know.

My love to everyone.<br><hr><br><b></b><br>Keato, what a great kid...always the life of the party we\'ll never forget you babe xox<br><hr><br><b>tash</b><br>i cant believe it, another one of our boys has gone. it only seems like yesterday i was watchin u keato on stage at pennywise singing \'bro hymn\', never in my life thought id be listening to that song and the words actually relating to you. i have only known you personally over the past year, and even in that short amount of time ive realised how much of a great person you are, and i cant believe i wont be able to see you again. Last time i saw you was a few weeks ago , and you had that horrible moustache, and u kept saying \" hey tash, Me scuzi...\" and i runup n gav u a hug, and that was my last. i remember how u wasted all my credit tryin to ring my brother on ur 21st, cuz u wanted him to come to ur party and when he finally got there u were in ur room, pretty much passed out but you were so happy to see him, he respects you so much n we both think your the biggest champ. your goin to be missed more than youll ever know by so many people. im so sorry to keatos family, i wish i could take your pain away but nothing anyone says could ease the hurt you are all feeling now. to all the boys, im so sorry another one of you has gone, and it sucks more than words can express...

Everyone has said it a thousand times when will people learn a lesson? Take care of yourself the dilly cant handle any more of this. I\'m sick of losing great people over something so pointless.

All that I am 
All that I ever was 
Is here in your perfect eyes 
They\'re all I can see 
I don\'t know where 
Confused about how as well 
I just know that these things 
Will never change for us at all

If I just lay here 
Would you lie with me 
And just forget the world<br><hr><br><b>Lucy (Matt Lye\'s Mum)</b><br>It is just so unfair.  The tears are flowing once more in the dilly. Our eyes are not even dry from Matt and Jack!!! Karen and I and our families are there for all of you.  If you need to talk, cry and or even just come and see us and not say anything we are there for you all!!!!! To Keato\'s family we know the pain your going through. Going to see them on Sunday was so so hard and we realised how everyone that came to see us must have fealt not knowing what to say, but without all the support of the family, prescious friends and the Dilly it would have been so much harder.  When I walked into Keato\'s house and the first person I saw was Cheryl (Keato\'s Aunty) who I know that was so hard and hearing that they had lost a 17 year old neice not long ago was worst.  We know that Dave, Matt and Jack and his cousin will be there for Keato.
The pain of watching you all hurting so so much is unbearable. I wish you all did not have to suffer like you all are. As parents we love you all so much never forget that.  We only try to protect you all. Love to everyone<br><hr><br><b>Fong</b><br>Keato. What can i say mate? when i heard the knews i my heart skipped a beat, then dropped. All through out school you were a mate. Funny, straight forward and didnt give a fuck, i admired that. Remember the days you had your old clanger of a kx80, trying to help adam jam chicken wire in the exhaust for a baffle, then hooning down rockford rd onto charlies point. You never missed a party, vodka slushies anyone?

Matty, Jack, Dave, Mitch and hamish too. But we know those boys will be waiting for you with a nice fresh ice cold Vitamin B. Although you have left us, be assure we will always be thinking about you and you shall never be forgotten. Rock On Dude.

I have simply just sat here for the past few hours reading and feeling so emotional at what this group of close friends have been through. As a parent, it is our worst fear to have to say goodbye to our children. No one should have to go through this, all I can say is that I congratulate the people involved in setting up this website. You have kept the spirit of all the boys alive and well. To the families, I wish you all nothing but happiness for the rest of your lives. What you have been through should make us all stop and think about the little things that bother us, god bless you all and take care. <br><hr><br><b>Jodie</b><br>Wow. I know none of you but feel so effected and saddened when reading this site and reading about your losses.   Love is everywhere here.  I wish you all lots of love and healing.

<br><hr><br><b>Amie (Hamish\'s cousin)</b><br>Hamish Fulham- if there\'s still any confusion as to how it\'s spelt.
thanks for everyones comments and wishes.
he was amazing. 
there were three of us, Hamish, Brooke and myself all born within 3 months of each other.
and it was hard to turn 18 without him.
he was so full of life and it would have meant so much to both Brooke and i to have seen out the year with him.
and now approaching Christmas i just wanted to extend all my love and thoughts to the family and friends of the other guys, because i know there is a lot of grief returning for me at this time.

love you Hamish xx. <br><hr><br><b>Mandy</b><br>I didn\'t know any of your beloved boys, but this site is a credit to them, and all of you. I have 3 boys, and can\'t begin to imagine what it would be like to lose one of them. So take care boys (and girls), and get home to your mum. She needs you. <br><hr><br><b></b><br>This is long but please read it and take extra care over the holidays
 The day I died was an ordinary school day. How I wish I had taken the bus, but I was too cool for the bus. I remember how I conned Mum to give me the car. \"Special favor\" I pleaded \"All the kids drive\". When the three fifteen bell rang I threw my books in a locker. Free until tomorrow morning. I ran to the car park excited with the thought of driving the car and being my own boss. Doesn\'t matter how the accident happened; I was showing off going too fast, taking crazy chances. I was enjoying my freedom and having fun. The last thing I remember was passing an old lady who seemed to be going awfully slow. (crash sound effect) I heard a crash, a terrific jolt. Glass and steel flew everywhere. My whole body seemed to be turning inside out, I heard myself scream. (scream sound effect).

Suddenly, I awakened. It was very quiet, a policeman was standing over me. I saw a doctor; my body was mangled, I was saturated in blood. Pieces of jagged glass were sticking out all over. Strange, that I couldn\'t feel anything. \"Hey, don\'t put that sheet over my head I can\'t be dead, Im only 17. I\'ve got a date tonight, I\'m supposed to have a wonderful life ahead of me, I\'m about to leave school, I haven\'t lived yet. I can\'t be... dead.\"

Later I was placed in a draw at the morgue; my parents came to identify me. Why did they have to see me like this? Why did I have to look at my mum\'s eyes when she faced the most terrible ordeal of her life. Dad suddenly looked very old. He told the man in charge \"Yes that\'s my daughter\". 

The funeral was weird, I saw all my relatives and friends walk toward the casket. They looked at me with the saddest eyes I\'ve ever seen. Some of my friends were crying. A few of the girls touched my hand and sobbed as they walked past.

\"Please, somebody wake me up get me out of here. I can\'t bear to see Mum and Dad in such pain. My grandparents are so weak with grief they can hardly walk, my brother and sister like zombies they move like robots, in a daze.\"

Everybody; no one can believe this. I can\'t believe it either. 

\"Please don\'t bury me, Im not dead, I have a lot of living to do. I want to laugh and run again, I want to sing and dance. Please don\'t put me in the ground. I promise if you give me just one more chance God I\'ll be the most careful driver in the whole world. All I want is one more chance. Please God, I\'m only 17.\"
<br><hr><br><b>Betty (David\'s mum)</b><br>This site never ceases to amaze me - after 2 years of it being set up by Narz (I don\'t know if he had any help)people-complete strangers- have happened across it and have been effected by the emotions it holds. To Mario, thank you for what you have said. The tragedies our kids have had to face is something we would never wish on our worst enemies. We are so proud of the kids, they have shown and due to circumstances beyond their control are still showing the greatest strengths and bonds and that is the positive that comes out of this \'hell on earth\' situation that we have all been dealt. What other area and group of kids has had to pull through ongoing tragedies over a 2 year period. As mentioned by a few people here, at 18 I hadn\'t faced the loss of any friends or even acquaintances- life and the future was good. 

I take my hat off to all you kids for the love and friendship you have shown each other. You are there to help each other when times are tough and you know we mums and dads are here if you need us.

Please take care over the holiday period. Your future is ahead of you, don\'t ever take things for granted. You all have so much to look forward to.

My love to everyone, and I know I will always be thankful for this site - to read the great messages and to be able to contribute has been a way of healing for me. Please take care everyone and Merry Christmas. <br><hr><br><b></b><br>This time of year just doesnt seem the same anymore no matter what we do, even trying to be happy coz they would want us to be is just to hard some days. holding them close daily just doesnt happen either and its hard. take care out there missin ya more everyday<br><hr><br><b></b><br>christmas eve wont be the same this year without our boys... missing you soooo much!! x<br><hr><br><b>tash</b><br>Merry christmas jack...

with a lifetime of smiles.
Made us know right from wrong,
always knowing of lies.
You made us be tough,
but never too rough
Rise above\'s what you said,
never easily lead.
And one day we\'ll all sing along;


Cause this is your song,
i wrote it for you.
It won\'t take all day,
just a minute or two.
You were our friend,
walk with you to the end.
And one day we\'ll all sing along;
Cause this is your song.

So we\'ll try and go on,
loving all that we know.
Through the hardest of times,
you put on a show.
You made us stand tall,
when all around us would fall.
Even when you were low,
you believed you could fly.
And one day we\'ll all sing along;

 the amount of people you guys touched and the memories we have is the only thing that can make us smile when we\'re down. i still scroll thru my phone and see your numbers and i just go numb, i cant i call u anymore and even worse, i know you wont be home.. it sucks.
 i hope you guys are having a blast wherever u are and sorry guys but ur gunna have to party with who u have now cause we dont want anyone else to leave us!

Sometimes i think i see you in a crowd but when i look again your not there.
Driving scares the hell out of me these days.
Watching any of my friends drive off makes me nervous. I hate that this has happened, i hate that we have no control and we\'re just spose to keep going. There is no justice for the amount of pain we have all gone through these last few years. I\'m so thankful that i have my friends to help me through all of this but it also makes me wonder... How long will they be there for?
What if this all just keeps happening. Is this what happens in life? You make friends and unbeleivable bonds with people, you grow with them, love them and then its all taken away. Gone.
It\'s just so pointless. I love you boys and i\'m missing you every day. Please take care of each other and remember we love you forever.

I do it because i miss the boys, Because it helps me keep going and because the love and bond the we have in the dilly is so amazing i never think i will completely understand it.
I hope my children grow up with people that are so laid back, loving, funny and genuinely care for each other. Working in Sydney people usually dont know where Picton or the Dilly is but i think that kind of adds to the beauty of it. 
I love that we dont have people all over the place and we have our own space to do our thing.

Would you still be holding kids in awe doing your crazy bike stunts and pushing yourself to the limit? Would you still be going to Cronulla and come home scratched to bits from the reef? Would you be a qualified carpenter? Would you still have your sideburns down to your chin? All these questions, but one thing I know for sure is that everyones life would be so much better if you were still here - you never ever knew how important you were to people and how many of us wished we had your sense of humour and ability to make people laugh (our lives are so much the better for your being here!) And now its your birthday on the 4th, you would have been 23. David we miss you so much and my tears are starting all over again just wishing we could celebrate your birthday with you here.

i\'ll never forget the feelings i\'ve gone through these last few years.
losing someone you love is the hardest thing to ever do.
sometimes i see a car that looks like one of yours and it brings back so many memories.
i often wonder what you would be doing now... i miss you
<br><hr><br><b></b><br>missing you more today then ever before nothings been the same since the day you left our world, and it never will be. Same days dreaming of you and looking over memories of our past just aint enough and today is one of those days.

It was the most gorgeous thing it would brighten my life every time i seen it.
We all know how blessed we are to have been a part of each of your lives and you will forever be a part of ours.
as i sway on the boarder of harsh reality and sweet dreams i am slowly learning that life will never be the same and you are gone forever no matter what any of us do.

Every story, every memory are all beautiful and i will cherish them forever.
I worry i\'m going to forget your laughs or your smiles or all those other goofy things you did. I know i will never forget but just the thought of forgetting scares the hell out of me.

It is obvious David met you guys (Blackwater?) and made a lasting impression, as he always did. I remember one of our boys telling me that David was his \'pitcrew\' and he (David) got introduced to one of the other well known riders at a meeting. Next meeting this particular rider remembered David but not the rider who he was helping out! (If that makes sense.) He is remembered in so many ways - his build (big Dave!), his beautiful black hair, his flashy smile, his wonderful sense of humour (which got him into trouble sometimes), his crazy antics - the list goes on and on..... Not many of us will be remembered and thought of every day like our beautiful boys here. Their effect on so many people of all ages will never cease to amaze me. The memories we have and the great times will keep their spirits alive forever. These kids will NEVER be forgotten and our lives are all the richer for knowing and loving them to bits.<br><hr><br><b>lachlan ross kennedy</b><br>your tricks were so smooth you stole our hearts david we miss you<br><hr><br><b>Bargo Girls </b><br>Missin All You Dilly Boys =[ but we all know it wasnt a goodbye cause we will all catch up soon enough.

WorkCover is investigating the death of a man yesterday afternoon at an explosion at a factory in the New South Wales southern highlands.

The ambulance service says two people were injured when a moulding machine exploded at the factory in Forestry Road at Penrose.

Paramedics arrived by helicopter, but they were unable to revive a man who had fallen 10 metres onto concrete and received serious head injuries.

Another person received minor burns and was taken to Bowral Hospital by a private vehicle.

Won\'t you sing me to sleep
And fly through my dreams
So I can hitch a ride with you tonight
And get away from this place
Have a new name and face
I just ain\'t the same without you in my life

Late night drives, all alone in my car
I can\'t help but start
Singing lines from all our favourite songs
And melodies in the air
Singin\' life just ain\'t fair
Sometimes I still just can\'t believe you\'re gone

And I\'m sure the view from heaven
Beats the hell out of mine here
And if we all believe in heaven,
Maybe we\'ll make it through one more year
Down here

Feel your fire,
When its cold in my heart
And things sorta start
Remindin\' me of my last night with you
I only need one more day
Just one more chance to say
I wish that I had gone up with you too

And I\'m sure the view from heaven
Beats the hell out of mine here
And if we all believe in heaven
Maybe we\'ll make it through one more year
Down here
You won\'t be comin\' back
And I didn\'t get to say goodbye (goodbye)
I really wish I got to say goodbye

And I\'m sure the view from heaven
Beats the hell out of mine here
And if we all believe in heaven
Maybe we\'ll make it through one more year
I hope that all is well in heaven
Cuz it\'s all shot to hell down here
I hope that I find you in heaven
Cuz I\'m so...
Lost without you down here

You won\'t be coming back
And I didn\'t get to say goodbye (goodbye)
I really wish I got to say gooooodbye.

Miss you so god damn much Jack. Love you xx

I just never really thought it could happen but now it just keep happening and as terrible as it is, every night i go to sleep and think what if it happens again tomorrow, and when i see an ambulance my heart pounds so much faster. I just wish things would go back to how they used to be<br><hr><br><b>Lucy</b><br>Well a year has passed since we lost our boys
I know how your were all feeling over Easter.
It has been the hardest year ever and I hate it because now I cannot say last year Matt you were here doing this or tha, working, doing crazy things.  You were my sanity I miss you so much!!
All you boys know how I was always telling him to put his shoes away that use to be at the front door well the pair of shoes he wore on the satureday night and then came home and changed into his sleeps are still at my front door waiting for him to come through that door and wear them again- If ony I wouldnot care if there were 50 pairs of shoes at the front door as long as I had my mouse back.
I want to thank all of you for your love and support - it was great seeing you all on Anzac day -the one person missing was Grant - I could not believe he was not there - I missed you.  Has Grant given up partying? What I have learnt is that we have to enjoy every minute of everyday andlive it like its your last.  My life has changed forever.  
Karen and Wayne and Allan and I have said we wish we would have socialised when our boys were here, I know they were always saying we would enjoy each others company and its so true -  I feel that we are not just friends they are part of our
family for the rest of our lives.
I know Matthew is around me I often feel like he is standing in the kitchen (of cause he would be in the kitchen he loved his food).
One thing I do know a broken heart can never be healed. we will get old but Matt and Jack will be forever young.

All i wanted to say

Never had i imagined
Living without your smile

It keeps me alive
Alive

And i know you\'re shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we\'ve lost along the way
And i know eventually we\'ll be togetherone sweet day

Darling, i never showed you
Assumed you\'d always be there
I took your presence for granted
But i always cared
And i miss the love we shared

And i know you\'re shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we\'ve lost along the way
And i know eventually we\'ll be together
One sweet day

Although the sun will never shine the same
I\'ll always look to a brighter day
Lord i know when i lay me down to sleep
You will always listen as i pray

And i know you\'re shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we\'ve lost along the way
And i know eventually we\'ll be together
One sweet day

Sometimes we find it hard to say things face to face and I am one of so many people who get on here and express how we feel, how things are going, to find out how others are going. These are some of the toughest times. From a mother - we aren\'t supposed to have our children taken away from us! We have helped them grow - seen them through sad and happy times and just when you think they are \'all grown up\'and the future looks OK, something beyond your control takes them away. I have said this before, thank you for this site and Shane all your mates are here for you. It is a very sad fact that there are other Dilly brothers and sisters who know just how you feel and they are there for one another. My love to everyone.<br><hr><br><b>Shae</b><br>Shane,
Just wanted to say we are so sorry. If you need someone to talk to or just someone to hug i am here. We have been thinking of you and how much BJ meant to all of us. He was such a character, so much fun. I remember him coming to my 18th dressed like a women just to be different. And thats what BJ was. Someone very special and that wont ever change.

Like all of you we miss them all so much.  For us we miss the nights when you would all arrive to go out and you would be waiting (some not so patiently) for Matt to get ready.  I really miss opening the rumpus room door on a Sunday morning and wondering who had crashed at our place that night- I dont think you all realise how much I really miss that Jack had the right idea now I know why he would always walk in with two drinks, he would patiently wait for Matt to get changed at least ten times a night.  I miss seeing the esks left at the front door (some still with some left over grog in them) you use to always seem to collect them by the end of the day.  We know how you are all feeling they were your friends and you had great times with them - you all have your own special memories.  I am afraid it is not getting any easier if any thing its getting harder. One thing Matt and Jack would be pleased about is that the Parker and Lye families have become family, they always said that we would of all got on fantastic -well this is certainly the case. I was saying to Matts dad today - Matt loved the Dilly so much I could not imagine moving away from here and all the fantastic people that live here.  The other day I ran into one of Matts old friends from Aussie Rules, the first question he asked me was how Matt was and how he was such a good Aussie Rules player - I had to hold back the tears and tell him what happened as he had been away and did not know.  Anyway my heart goes out to the families who more recently have lost a loved one.  
Naz thank you for doing this site you are fantastic and a great friend to the boys.  Naz is you that drives the ute that looks similar to Matts?   Luv to you all and the doors always open.  Also to Feno happy 21st I will catch up with you soon.

.....Jack......

There's a truth begging to be told
 As the blues grab and take a hold
 To continue like this only acts as a force for no good. I just wanna say that I miss you
And I've felt pitiful, since you've been gone
Just trying to say I need something I can lean against So I'm gonna steady myself on a reliable friend. There's a weight dragging through my days
That I've spent trying to fill the space
That's been there since the day that we parted and made our goodbyes.
And there's a truth begging to be told
As the blues grab and take a hold
And I just can't believe when I wake up that you could be gone...I just wanna say that I miss you
And I've felt pitiful, since you've been gone
Just trying to say I need something I can lean against
So I'm gonna steady myself on a reliable friend...
i miss you soo much jack...i will for eternity. thinking of you always. love you! xoxoxox

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br><hr><br><b>Mazzy</b><br>Miss you more everyday <br><hr><br><b>Chantal</b><br>To my beautiful nephew, Hamish Fulham, just what your dad said, you are a shining light whose flame can never be extinguished. You touched many hearts. You will always be 'forever young' to us. Until we meet again. Luv you. xox<br><hr><br><b></b><br>HAPPY BIRTHDAY KEATO!!!! XOXOXOXOX<br><hr><br><b>Kim Usher</b><br>I've only just found this site, on a day when Teddy Graham was hovering on my mind. I am so sorry to hear of the losses that you have all been through, over and over again. I'll never forget David walking out of his year 10 English class and into mine at random moments, and having him just be so hillarious that I'd have to laugh before finding a way to coax him back. Please stay safe guys ... and my email is still the same: grizzlette@yahoo.com.au ... i'd love to hear from you xo<br><hr><br><b></b><br>Hey Boys! I think about all of you everyday. Not one day goes by wen i dont think about Davey, or Mitch, Matty, Jacko n Keato! I always think of how Keato became my hero jus b4 he passed away. Mitch n his stories. Mattys hair always looked better than mine and Jack always had something smart to say and Davey ohhh jus everything about him, i still have a huge smile on my face whenever i think about him! Ian i have to say you remind me of him a lot. Sometimes you'll pull a face n it'l be his. All of our DILLY BOYS are awesome, from smiles to laughs and from the first day we met you to the last time we saw you, yous amazed us in every way possible! The families of these boys ought to be so proud of the boys they have raised because I must say if my children turn out half as great as them i will be so proud! I know that where ever i go i have 5 great guardian angels watching over everyone in the Dilly! I think with all the boys put together they wud have known almost ALL of the Dilly! I am so greatful to have known them. I love you all so very much, and miss you everyday more and more. It isnt getting easier but i am learning how to deal with it by turning my tears of sadness into tears of laughter... Miss  you and Love you XOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOX<br><hr><br><b>Betty</b><br>Thank you to Kim Usher and the other person for relating a couple of memories of David. I just love to read the ways in which David has left his mark on people - people who I don't even know. David was a bugger at school, a teacher's nightmare, but he was fortunate to have that great personality and 'harmless' nature that you couldn't take offence and couldn't stay angry for too long. He would just give you one of his looks and you would crack up laughing.
I wanted to let you know that I had a dream with David in it last night. I was sitting next to one of his mates and Grant Fairley was down the road. I waved at him and saw David with him and he waved back. I asked the person (I can't remember who it was)next to me if he could see David and he said no. The next thing David was walking past me (with dreadlocks and clean shaven - looking about 18)and I asked him where he was going and he said "just going bmx riding" and I just told him to be careful. That was it - I woke up, but it seemed so real...anyway, just wanted to tell you.

My love to everyone and remember if any of you have memories of our boys, us mums like to read them after all they probably spent more time with mates than at home (David did, anyway!)

Also, if anyone has or knows of anyone who may have videos, etc., with David (be it at parties, riding, or whatever) please let me know as Ross is putting all that we have together on a dvd. Thanks. <br><hr><br><b></b><br>We all miss the boys more than can be put in to words..but all the familys love more than anything now, having you boys come and our homes i know its hard for you boys...but you were a part of the boys as they are part of you....please come and visit us ...you have no idea how much it means...love you all boys an gals...xox<br><hr><br><b>No Name</b><br>i miss you..<br><hr><br><b></b><br>My gosh Mitch, cant believe 2mora its been 2yrs since you left us, Missing you more then ever. xx<br><hr><br><b>My Mitchell</b><br>were has the time gone i cant believe that its been two years since you last smiled at me or laughed with us all.

Searley u were entertainment and a very genuine person.Matt... I had never lost someone I was so close to in my life until losing you.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br><hr><br><b>Jacko's Big Bro (Trent)</b><br>well !!!

How overwhelming.....

I have a lot of reading to do.....

I've just come accross this website on 20 aug 2007

To the friends of my brother Jack, and friends of Matt Lye and friends of the Dilly Boys who have passed on previously and since:    WE THANK YOU!!<br><hr><br><b></b><br>Hey Boys,
Haven't posted for a while.
Still miss you and think about you all the time.
Never am really sure what to say...
I suppose just that i do still come on here just to see you all. That i will never forget any of your beautiful souls. And that i'm glad i grew up in the Dilly. Love Love People. XxX<br><hr><br><b>Dearest Davey</b><br>Hey sweetie, how are ya?? Its been so long since I have posted a comment. People hav told me that time will heal all the pain I and everyone else is feeling, but I am not sure it will because now i think about you and it just reminds me of how long ago it was since i last spoke to you or saw u smile or seen you driving past! I was just sitting down in my room the other day and I was thinking about how long it has been since we had seen you last and remembering all the memories that i and evryone kno and share with you and i just started to cry! I know that you are still floating around watching over your family and close friends but i just wish we could see you! I wont say just one more time because i am being selfish i want it to be more than one more i want you to be here all the time like you used to be. Its just not the same. Time will never heal the emptiness in our lives no matter what anyone will say, Dave you are irreplaceable. 
Sometimes i sit and wish i could just talk to you, hug you or even just sit there and look at you, just to have you in my presence. Your an angel. I thank you for being a part of my life and letting me be a part of yours. I love you xox. I miss you! Please come back home and bring our Matt, Jack, Mitch, Keato back with you. XOX with love, XOX<br><hr><br><b>Testing line break</b><br>Test <br>

test<br><hr><br><b>DILLY BOYS THROUGH AND THROUGH</b><br>Everyone cries <br>
When a Dilly Boy dies <br>
They are now stars above<br>
Filling everyone with love<br>
And drying those red eyes<br>
<br>
First there was Dave<br>
Whose friendship people still crave<br>
He loved to ride<br>
He filled his friends with pride<br>
David was a Dilly Boy Fave<br>
<br>
I still cannot believe I lost my brother Jack<br>
Who will always have the Dilly Boys back<br>
He was a younger brother that I looked up to<br>
He was loved by more than a few<br>
No area of his personality did he lack<br>
<br>
Gone with Jack was Matt Lye<br>
Hairspray, he always had to buy<br>
To look as good as he can<br>
He was the most beautiful Dilly Boy Man<br>
Or at lease he could try<br>
<br>
Keato with his Mohawk<br>
Made everyone Gawk<br>
But he was an excellent Dilly Boy Bloke<br>
Testament to which everybody spoke<br>
He still makes people talk<br>
<br>
Then there was BJ<br>
The rumours were kept at bay<br>
I remember him from Tennis<br>
Apparently he could be a bit of a menace<br>
Once again we pray<br>
<br>
To those not mentioned above<br>
Iâ€™m sure people give lots of love<br>
But are people I didnâ€™t really know<br>
But a fate I wish not on friend or foe<br>
I pray to heaven above<br>
<br>
To those Dilly boys that remain<br>
Time to think with your brain<br>
Take heed<br>
Do not speed<br>
Or better yet, take the train<br>
<br>
To the ladies of the men<br>
I hope your on the mend<br>
They say that time will heal<br>
But how do you feel? <br>
We must stop this devastating trend<br>
<br>
Yes they enjoyed a brew<br>
If driving; just a few<br>
Some of them enjoyed Cruisers<br>
But they were not bruisers<br>
They are Dilly Boys Through and Through. <br>

Why don't you tell us more!<br><hr><br><b></b><br>Trent that was so beautiful and cute and true!.

Whether this is correct or not I am not 100% sure.<br><hr><br><b></b><br>Hey boys,
havent posted or even been on here in a couple of months.
but i still think about you all the time.
Keato i drive past your site everyday to go to work as i'm sure many people would.
still giving you kisses every time.
missing you boys all the time.
we are all so lucky to have you be a part of our lives and to be a part of yours.
i'll remember you all forever.
<br><hr><br><b>lachlan</b><br>R.I.P dave. I remember seeing you at bargo sk8a with pink peddels<br><hr><br><b>Betty</b><br>And isn't it hard to even believe that it is almost 3 years since we have seen him. Not a day goes by without thinking of David and the impact he had on us and I know there won't be a single day that David won't cross my mind on and off during that 24 hours. The tears still come and as it gets closer to the 29th the empty feeling grows, and I sit and wonder still if it really is true. But the memories can't be taken away. My love to everyone.<br><hr><br><b>shane(bjs brother)</b><br>we just had bjs 6month and who said time makes it easyer? i still have to tell myself everyday to get up and keep living. if you havnt heard ive moved to townsville so hopefuly i can sort my head out. i still dont know how you live without your son,bother or best mate.















<br><hr><br><b>DAVEY</b><br>my sweet guy davey; i miss so much babe! thankyou for all that you left me with, its been a long hard road by but things are ok, im ok! iv learnt so much from you somebody once told me i would and i didnt believe them but now its all so true! you left me a gift, you gave me so much! i feel you around all the time and i know your sweet eyes are looking over me and i know your smiling! your pictures still light up my room, and every now and then i smell your smell! i miss you so much! and i want to thankyou for all the joy and happiness you gave me! so many firsts and you know it! it was an amazing experience! especially thanx for the last couple of months you were around, our late night drives, you helped me with all my troubles, made me feel at ease! you left a big chnuk of yourself with me and i feel so right! not one day goes by and you know that too! I'll miss you forever! nobody can take those memories! i love you, still so much and i always will!<br><hr><br><b>Betty</b><br>As the days get closer to it being 3 years since David last went out the front door to go to work, I guess maybe I am feeling a bit more emotional than usual. I have just read a few words that one mum who has lost 3 little children has on a pillow in her home and it has brought me to tears. It says "A mother holds her children's hands for a while, their hearts forever". How true she is. I can't even begin to comprehend how losing 3 children would feel - sometimes I wonder if we could feel any deeper sadness, but I am sure that this poor mum is feeling it 3 times over.

I am going to see a lady next Monday who I am hoping will connect with David...I will keep you posted.<br><hr><br><b></b><br>Thinking of you today Dave 
xxxx<br><hr><br><b>Jenny, Nathan and Ryan Davis</b><br>Your are always in our thoughts and forever in our hearts.<br><hr><br><b>Betty</b><br>What an emotional day. Ian and I visited David this morning and placed some new bits and pieces with him. Ian bought a couple of great ornaments which are appropriate to David. Time doesn't make things any easier and these emotions are something I don't have control over today. I am going to see a lady now and am taping what she has to say. I will be on here first thing tomorrow if she is able to tell me anything. My love to you all.<br><hr><br><b>To Betty, Ian, Shannon and ALL the ANDREWS Family</b><br>I can not begin to imagine how you all must be feeling everyday and today of course! My heart is with you! Just always know how loved David is! We all still look up to him, just now its in more ways than 1! He is dearly missed and FOREVER LOVED!!!!! 

DAVEY!!!! WE LOVE YOU!!! XOX!!!! You are truly one in a million! <br><hr><br><b>Betty</b><br>Well, the medium had alot to say. She actually reached my mum, dad and sister first and was pretty accurate - even told me my dad was holding up his hands in front of her and had the top of his finger missing, which he did! She didn't pick up riding bikes and doing stunts etc with David but picked up on other stuff. She saw how he had the accident, but I won't go into detail - I felt better after I listened to her. She is actually the third person to tell me the first person to be waiting for him was an older man and the second person to tell me he was working with the children (helping the 8-12 with basketball and rounders - even though this sounds a bit over the top). She saw him to be good looking, dark haired with a great smile and a big belly laugh. She told me that David wanted me to smile again and to 'get on with it'- which he used to say to me, but actually 'get over it'. I have it all on tape and will listen to it over and over. I am glad I saw this lady - the hurt and emptiness will never go away but there seem to be too many coincidences for there not to be something else after we pass. Thank you to all of you for your messages.<br><hr><br><b>IAN</b><br>Just a reminder guys we've got another jam comin up on the 24th of nov its a saturday make sure u r there tell everyone u no for this wil b the last ride it called "thanks for the memories"lets all get down there support the day n lets raise a lil money 2 go back into a driver education course for our up coming dillians we all need to look after each come down n make some noise one more time its at the dna dirt park at tahmoor we're the last one was held take care everyone n i'l c u on saturday 24th november at the dirt park <br><hr><br><b>Beck</b><br>Hey Shaneo...hope your taking care of yourself up there..and to all see you at DNA...xox <br><hr><br><b>Beck Lye</b><br><br><hr><br><b></b><br>Matt, it is your 24th birthday on Wednesday the 21st...Happy Birthday to my goergeous brother..

If youre driving be extra careful on the roads and take care with whatever you are doing.

I had a visit recently from Darren Moon, the policeman who attended David's accident. It wasnt until we spoke last week that I fully realised the ongoing emotional problems of having to be the person to tell families of tragedies. Darren has been struggling with the guilt of having to be the one to tell our family about David and I was so upset and felt helpless knowing that I couldn't help him through a really tough time. We need to always remember  the policemen, ambos, rescuers etc who have deal with traumatic situations day in day out and Darren we thank you for being there for us 3 years ago....I just wish I could help you now... These guys are unsung heroes and we must always remember that!

My love and best wishes to everyone.  <br><hr><br><b>Davids Dad</b><br>Nothing can replace our boys, not even the years as they go by, but we know that they will, forever be together.

You should have been 24 today. The heavens have opened up today and it seems the raindrops count for all the tears that have fallen over the past 3 and a bit years. David we miss you more than ever and not a day goes by that we don't think of you. I am sending you all our love to you on your birthday. You were such a character and not a day went by when you were here that you didn't put a smile on someone's face. You made so many people's lives so much better having you around and those memories we will have forever. I have a poem for you David which I send with all my love:
Theres a special Angel in Heaven that is a part of me. It is not where I wanted him, but where God wanted him to be. He was here but just a moment like a night time shooting star. And though he is in Heaven, he isn't very far. He touched the hearts of many like only Angels can. I would've held him every minute if I'd only known God's plan. So I send this special message to the Heavens up above. Please take care of my Angel and send him all my love. Mum.<br><hr><br><b></b><br>Betty my thoughts are always with you and your  family. You have a beautiful son, one that touched many lives, he will live on through us.

Take Care, all my love and heartfelt thoughts to you all. x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x<br><hr><br><b>Carolyn (keatos mum )</b><br>I am so sorry i havent been on this site before,i am amazed by how much all our lost boys have impacted everyones lives,to my dearest son mat im totally lost without you,you truely are amazing your character, your wit,your beautiful looks, those eyes the list could go on and on. I see so much of you in your little nephew 'Byron Mathew Keating' who will get told about the wonderful person you were and what a wonderful uncle you would have been and possibly still are as we know you will forever be watching over him. Your dad and your brothers ,Rob and Phil miss you greatly and wish you were still here, but realise that you'll be with them forever.Nothing can ever fill the void in our lives but through the love and support from all of your mates and theirs and our families we are learning to try and cope a little better. And to all our other lost dilly boys and girls families i now know how difficult and sad it is to lose such a cherished  part of your family.all our love always,to our beautiful son mat, forever in our hearts mum, dad phil,rob,becka,byron,sam,cody and marve. and to all your mates  im so sorry you lost such a great mate in keato. <br><hr><br><b></b><br>our five Dilly Boys have now made up the Southern Cross, each one a different star. I was thinking about it last night and thats what I have come to. When i look up and see it i will think of our five boys and how much we love and miss them<br><hr><br><b>Betty</b><br>And while you are looking up in that direction remember David, Matt and Jack actually have 3 stars named after them - they are called Our Three Wise Men. These stars are visible to the naked eye and we do have their exact locations. So they will be shining lights forever.<br><hr><br><b>Ash</b><br>missing u guys every day, i hope ur enjoying urself, and know how much u meant to everyone, xx<br><hr><br><b></b><br> "hey little boy"

Wishing you were here with us instead of watching over us. luv you all<br><hr><br><b>Ash</b><br>well... coming up to two years matty and jack and must say its not any easier, the tears dont come quite as often, but the thoughts memories and sadness is still present every day. you never realise how much you see qualities of one, in someone else, until they are gone, i see you guys in other people all the time. or maybe im searching to find similarities so that i can smile thinking your still here in some way. 
when i go to see u its like i know i can let it all out. and in some way it feels better that i have, almost like i kno ur listening and ud be telling me to stop whinging like u always did. i hope ur enjoying urselves boys, ALL of u!!, getting into mischief and watching over us. miss u heaps..

The past two years have felt like a life time and yet it feels like it was only yesterday.  I cant wait to see your beautiful faces again. I hope your waiting for me.   Love you x <br><hr><br><b></b><br>Goodbye, For now! 
Don’t you get discouraged by the way, 
don’t you let the distance get you down.
Goodbye, goodbye,
for now. 
Take yourself down to the ocean soon
Wash away the miles because I’m close to you
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye,
for now.
Don’t let it go, 
this good thing that we’ve got.
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, 
for now.
Scenery keeps changing every day.
Go away, the emptiness is easier
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, 
for now.
We’ll be the ones, we’ll be the ones, who show them. 
Cause tomorrow you’ll be in our arms again.
Don’t ever let it go, this good thing that we’ve got.
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye,
for Now. 
Goodbye, goodbye, for now! 
We’ll be the ones who show them, 
cause tomorrow you’ll be in our arms again. 
Don’t ever let it go, this good thing that we’ve got. 
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, 
for now.

<br><hr><br><b>chantelle</b><br>thinking of you today hamish. Miss you so much xo<br><hr><br><b></b><br>thinkin of you all missing your amazing smiles<br><hr><br><b>Ryann</b><br>Hopefully got it all fixed up now guys!<br><hr><br>
<b>Betty</b><br>Wow, every day at work I get onto this site, and had the usual feeling of all the rubbishy stuff thats on it. It was great to scroll down to see none of it on there. I have tried a couple of times to leave thoughts but havent had any luck.

David would have been 25 last month, so hard to even comprehend that. I wonder often what he would be like - would he still be the fun-loving crazy person we all loved...I would hope so. And would he bring smiles to everyone's faces and make people laugh...yes, he would have never lost that wonderful trait!

Ian will be moving to Canberra shortly to work and is going on a short holiday to Tassie soon and hoping to catch up with one of the Rally (?) twins while there. Deirdre is having another baby, due September...I know David would be still asking "havent you brought a TV yet?" Others all OK. Jackson and Bailey started school this year and so far so good.

I hope you are all doing well in whatever youre doing, and thank you again for fixing the site up.<br><hr><br><b>angie batey</b><br>missing you so much mat (keato) love aunty angie xx<br><hr><br><b>Ryann</b><br>Hey Betty, Its fine, im glad we could get it up all working again and can focus on making this a great place to share our memories.. i miss all the boys so much, i think of them at least once during the day.. usually multiple<br><hr><br><b>jimmy greene</b><br>rest in peace boyz<br><hr><br><b>Ronny</b><br>miss all u boys think of you all everyday, searley we will have 2 think up of a team slip name for u<br><hr><br><b>11.11</b><br>And the load

Hope everyone has a safe and enjoyable long weekend.<br><hr><br><b>Betty</b><br>I knew I missed this site and getting onto it to keep in touch, but didn't realise how much I missed it until I got on here today to see some familiar names still putting down their thoughts -it was like old friends getting back in touch. In time more and more people will realise that Ryan has fixed the problem..I know when I spoke with Ross over Easter he didnt realise it was working again. We can never thank you enough Ryan. There are so many of us who think about our boys countless times during each day and I myself find this site a wonderful way of helping get me through. My love to everyone.<br><hr><br><b>carolyn keating</b><br>Hi to all you dilly folks that miss all our loved ones so much,they are all so very special to us in so many ways, Mat,my darling beautiful son i miss everything about you , from your laughter,your jokes,your beautiful smile,your genuine loveable nature ,your messy bedroom,just thought i would add that one in,i miss it all. our lives are so empty without you, you are missing out on so much,your beautiful little nephew Byron for one thing and a new addition to the family due in june, a little sibling for Byron, its just so unfair that we have to communicate this way i feel such imense sorrow for all who have to go through this.but i also feel imense gratitude for the support and love shown by so many people,and i would also like to add a thankyou to Ryann fo cleaning up the site its disgraceful to know that someone would put that muck on this website as this is one of the only ways that we can share our memories with people, hopefully this wont happen again.love to all and stay safe everyone.Keatos mum xxx    <br><hr><br><b></b><br>Wow great to see this up &amp; running again, have missed it.

Everyone has made the best of life and moved on the best they can, so many tears are still being cried for you all. I swear Dave i heard your voice the other night, 2am i was up couldn't sleep. So silent in the house where my little family are sleeping, i turned the kettle on for a warm milo, and i heard you say "hi sweety" It was perfect, i know i didn't imagine it as right at that moment i was thinking about something different. it shocked me, took my breath away, bought me to tears and made me smile. It is the first time in a long time since i have felt you with me. I think about you every single day and i drift away to alot of precious moments we shared. It always makes me smile. As time goes on i have learnt to live without you, but the pain of having to is endless. I still wish i could just see you for one moment, to hug you, just to let you know how much i love you. life is going well for me but without you in my life it isn't complete. Miss you dave, rest in peace my beautiful angel.<br><hr><br><b>missing you</b><br>missing you so much. loving you more then ever. a fimiliar smell of you i smelt while out doing my christmas shopping. it bought me to tears. you are still apart of my everyday movements. i can never forget the impact you left in my life. i wish i could just have one more day with you or even just one second. so hard without you here. i just hope you are proud of the life i have made, but would give alot of it up to have you here again. xxxxxxxxx<br><hr><br><b>missing you</b><br>missing you so much. loving you more then ever. a fimiliar smell of you i smelt while out doing my christmas shopping. it bought me to tears. you are still apart of my everyday movements. i can never forget the impact you left in my life. i wish i could just have one more day with you or even just one second. so hard without you here. i just hope you are proud of the life i have made, but would give alot of it up to have you here again. xxxxxxxxx love you davexxxxx
